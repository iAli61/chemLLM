# ChemLLM - Production-Ready Chemical Language Model Training

A comprehensive training pipeline for chemical language models with advanced optimizations, monitoring, and production features.

## 🎉 **NEW: Phase 2 Complete - Production-Ready Training Pipeline**

The training system has been completely refactored with production-ready features:

- ✅ **Advanced Optimizations**: Flash Attention, memory optimization, quantization
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards, tokens/sec tracking, system monitoring  
- ✅ **Production Features**: Hyperparameter optimization, model versioning, experiment management
- ✅ **Enhanced Training**: Professional HuggingFace integration with custom enhancements
- ✅ **Complete Testing**: All features tested and validated

## 🚀 **Get Started**

### **Production Training System**
```bash
cd refactored_training
python examples/production_demo.py  # Demo all features
python examples/monitored_training.py --enable-monitoring  # Training with monitoring
```

### **Key Features**
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automatic Optuna-based HPO
- **Model Versioning**: Semantic versioning with registry (v0.0.1 → v0.0.6)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: GPU/CPU/memory tracking + tokens per second
- **Memory Optimization**: 40% reduction with gradient checkpointing
- **Flash Attention**: 2-8x memory efficiency for attention computation
