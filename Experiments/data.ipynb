         "The laws of probability apply to events that are independent. If the result of one trial depends on the result of another trial, we may still be able to use the laws of probability. However, to do so, we must know the nature of the interdependence. If the activity associated with event C precedes the activity associated with event D , the probability of D may depend on whether C occurs. Suppose that the first activity is tossing a coin and that the second activity is drawing a card from a deck; however, the deck we use depends on whether the coin comes up heads or tails. If the coin is heads, we draw a card from an ordinary deck; if the coin is tails, we draw a coin from a deck with the face cards removed. Now we ask about the probability of drawing an ace. If the coin is heads, the probability of drawing an ace is \\({4}/{52}={1}/{13}\\). If the coin is tails, the probability of drawing an ace is \\({4}/{40}={1}/{10}\\). The combination coin is heads and card is ace has probability: \\(\\left({1}/{2}\\right)\\left({1}/{13}\\right)={1}/{26}\\). The combination coin is tails and card is ace has probability \\(\\left({1}/{2}\\right)\\left({1}/{10}\\right)={1}/{20}\\). In this case, the probability of drawing an ace depends on the modification we make to the deck based on the outcome of the coin toss. Applying the laws of probability is straightforward. An example that illustrates the application of these laws in a transparent way is provided by villages First, Second, Third, and Fourth, which are separated by rivers. (See Figure 1.) Bridges \\(1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(3\\) span the river between First and Second. Bridges \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) span the river between Second and Third. Bridges \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) span the river between Third and Fourth. A traveler from First to Fourth who is free to take any route he pleases has a choice from among \\(3\\times 2\\times 4=24\\) possible combinations. Let us consider the probabilities associated with various events: There are 24 possible routes. If a traveler chooses his route at random, the probability that he will take any particular route is \\({1}/{24}\\). This illustrates our assumption that each event in a set of \\(N\\) exhaustive and mutually exclusive events occurs with probability \\({1}/{N}\\). If he chooses a route at random, the probability that he goes from First to Second by either bridge \\(1\\) or bridge \\(2\\) is \\(P\\left(1\\right)+P\\left(2\\right)=\\ {1}/{3}+{1}/{3}={2}/{3}\\). This illustrates the calculation of the probability of alternative events. The probability of the particular route \\(2\\to a\\to C\\) is \\(P\\left(2\\right)\\times P\\left(a\\right)\\times P\\left(C\\right)=\\left({1}/{3}\\right)\\left({1}/{2}\\right)\\left({1}/{4}\\right)={1}/{24}\\), and we calculate the same probability for any other route from First to Fourth. This illustrates the calculation of the probability of a compound event. If he crosses bridge \\(1\\), the probability that his route will be \\(2\\to a\\to C\\) is zero, of course. The probability of an event that has already occurred is 1, and the probability of any alternative is zero. If he crosses bridge \\(1,\\) \\(P\\left(1\\right)=1\\), and \\(P\\left(2\\right)=P\\left(3\\right)=0\\). Given that a traveler has used bridge \\(1\\), the probability of the route \\(1\\to a\\to C\\) becomes the probability of path \\(a\\to C\\), which is \\(P\\left(a\\right)\\times P\\left(C\\right)=\\left({1}/{2}\\right)\\left({1}/{4}\\right)={1}/{8}\\). Since \\(P\\left(1\\right)=1\\), the probability of the compound event \\(1\\to a\\to C\\) is the probability of the compound event \\(a\\to C\\). The outcomes of rolling dice, rolling provide more illustrations. If we roll two dice, we can classify the possible outcomes according to the sums of the outcomes for the individual dice. There are thirty-six possible outcomes. They are displayed in Table 1. Table 1: Outcomes from tossing two dice 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NaN Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for first die Outcome for second die NaN 1 2 3 4 5 6 Outcome for second die 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Outcome for second die 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Outcome for second die 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Outcome for second die 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Outcome for second die 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Outcome for second die 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Let us consider the probabilities associated with various dice-throwing events: The probability of any given outcome, say the first die shows \\(2\\) and the second die shows \\(3\\), is \\({1}/{36}\\). Since the probability that the first die shows \\(3\\) while the second die shows \\(2\\) is also \\({1}/{36}\\), the probability that one die shows \\(2\\) and the other shows \\(3\\) is \\[P\\left(3\\right)\\times P\\left(2\\right)+P\\left(2\\right)\\times P\\left(3\\right) =\\left({1}/{36}\\right)+\\left({1}/{36}\\right) ={1}/{18}. \\nonumber \\] Four different outcomes correspond to the event that the score is \\(5\\). Therefore, the probability of rolling \\(5\\) is \\[P\\left(1\\right)\\times P\\left(4\\right)+P\\left(2\\right)\\times P\\left(3\\right) +P\\left(3\\right)\\times P\\left(2\\right)+P\\left(4\\right)\\times P\\left(1\\right) ={1}/{9} \\nonumber \\] The probability of rolling a score of three or less is the probability of rolling \\(2\\), plus the probability of rolling \\(3\\) which is \\(\\left({1}/{36}\\right)+\\left({2}/{36}\\right)={3}/{36}={1}/{12}\\) Suppose we roll the dice one at a time and that the first die shows \\(2\\). The probability of rolling \\(7\\) when the second die is thrown is now \\({1}/{6}\\), because only rolling a \\(5\\) can make the score 7, and there is a probability of \\({1}/{6}\\) that a \\(5\\) will come up when the second die is thrown. Suppose the first die is red and the second die is green. The probability that the red die comes up \\(2\\) and the green die comes up \\(3\\) is \\(\\left({1}/{6}\\right)\\left({1}/{6}\\right)={1}/{36}\\). Above we looked at the number of outcomes associated with a score of \\(3\\) to find that the probability of this event is \\({1}/{18}\\). We can use another argument to get this result. The probability that two dice roll a score of three is equal to the probability that the first die shows \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) times the probability that the second die shows whatever score is necessary to make the total equal to three. This is: \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(first\\ die\\ shows\\ 1\\ or\\ 2\\right)\\times \\left({1}/{6}\\right) &= \\left[\\left({1}/{6}\\right)+\\left({1}/{6}\\right)\\right]\\times {1}/{6} \\\\[4pt] &={2}/{36} \\\\[4pt]& ={1}/{18} \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] Application of the laws of probability is frequently made easier by recognizing a simple restatement of the requirement that events be mutually exclusive. In a given trial, either an event occurs or it does not. Let the probability that an event A occurs be \\(P\\left(A\\right)\\). Let the probability that event A does not occur be \\(P\\left(\\sim A\\right)\\). Since in any given trial, the outcome must belong either to event A or to event \\(\\sim A\\), we have \\[P\\left(A\\right)+P\\left(\\sim A\\right)=1 \\nonumber \\] For example, if the probability of success in a single trial is \\({2}/{3}\\), the probability of failure is \\({1}/{3}\\). If we consider the outcomes of two successive trials, we can group them into four events. Event SS: First trial is a success; second trial is a success. Event SF: First trial is a success; second trial is a failure. Event FS: First trial is a failure; second trial is a success. Event FF: First trial is a failure; second trial is a failure. Using the laws of probability, we have \\[ \\begin{align*} 1 &=P\\left(Event\\ SS\\right)+P\\left(Event\\ SF\\right)+P\\left(Event\\ FS\\right)+\\ P(Event\\ FF) \\\\[4pt] &=P_1\\left(S\\right)\\times P_2\\left(S\\right)+P_1\\left(S\\right)\\times P_2\\left(F\\right) +P_1(F)\\times P_2(S)+P_1(F)\\times P_2(F) \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] where \\(P_1\\left(X\\right)\\) and \\(P_2\\left(X\\right)\\) are the probability of event \\(X\\) in the first and second trials, respectively. This situation can be mapped onto a simple diagram. We represent the possible outcomes of the first trial by line segments on one side of a unit square \\(P_1\\left(S\\right)+P_1\\left(F\\right)=1\\). We represent the outcomes of the second trial by line segments along an adjoining side of the unit square. The four possible events are now represented by the areas of four mutually exclusive and exhaustive portions of the unit square as shown in Figure 2."

         "One important consequence of Botlzmann’s proposal is that a perfectly ordered crystal (i.e. one that has only one energetic arrangement in its lowest energy state) will have an entropy of 0. This makes entropy qualitatively different than other thermodynamic functions. For example, in the case of enthalpy, it is impossible have a zero to the scale without setting an arbitrary reference (which is that the enthalpy of formation of elements in their standard states is zero.) But entropy has a natural zero! It is the state at which a system has perfect order. This also has another important consequence, in that it suggests that there must also be a zero to the temperature scale. These consequences are summed up in the Third Law of Thermodynamics . The entropy of a perfectly ordered crystal at 0 K is zero. This also suggests that absolute molar entropies can be calculated by \\[S = \\int_o^{T} \\dfrac{C}{T} dT \\nonumber \\] where \\(C\\) is the heat capacity. An entropy value determined in this manner is called a Third Law Entropy . Naturally, the heat capacity will have some temperature dependence. It will also change abruptly if the substance undergoes a phase change. Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to measure heat capacities very near zero K. Fortunately, many substances follow the Debye Extrapolation in that at very low temperatures, their heat capacities are proportional to T 3 . Using this assumption, we have a temperature dependence model that allows us to extrapolate absolute zero based on the heat capacity measured at as low a temperature as can be found. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) SiO 2 is found to have a molar heat capacity of 0.777 J mol -1 K -1 at 15 K (Yamashita, et al., 2001). Calculate the molar entropy of SiO 2 at 15 K. Solution Using the Debye model, the heat capacity is given by The value of a can be determined by The entropy is then calculated by Calculating a third Law Entropy Start at 0 K, and go from there!"

Most people find waterbeds uncomfortable unless the water temperature is maintained at about 85 °F. Unless it is heated, a waterbed that contains 892 L of water cools from 85 °F to 72 °F in 24 hours. Estimate the amount of electrical energy required over 24 hours, in kWh, to keep the bed from cooling. Note that 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3.6 10 6 J, and assume that the density of water is 1.0 g/mL (independent of temperature). What other assumptions did you make? How did they affect your calculated result (i.e., were they likely to yield “positive” or “negative” errors)? 14. A 500-mL bottle of water at room temperature and a 2-L bottle of water at the same temperature were placed in a refrigerator. After 30 minutes, the 500-mL bottle of water had cooled to the temperature of the refrigerator. An hour later, the 2-L of water had cooled to the same temperature. When asked which sample of water lost the most heat, one student replied that both bottles lost the same amount of heat because they started at the same temperature and finished at the same temperature. A second student thought that the 2-L bottle of water lost more heat because there was more water. A third student believed that the 500-mL bottle of water lost more heat because it cooled more quickly.

         "Learning Objectives Write ionic equations for chemical reactions between ionic compounds. Write net ionic equations for chemical reactions between ionic compounds. For single-replacement and double-replacement reactions, many of the reactions included ionic compounds—compounds between metals and nonmetals, or compounds that contained recognizable polyatomic ions. Now, we take a closer look at reactions that include ionic compounds. One important aspect about ionic compounds that differs from molecular compounds has to do with dissolution in a liquid, such as water. When molecular compounds, such as sugar, dissolve in water, the individual molecules drift apart from each other. When ionic compounds dissolve, the ions physically separate from each other . We can use a chemical equation to represent this process—for example, with NaCl: \\[\\ce{ NaCl(s) ->[\\ce{H2O}] Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)}\\nonumber \\] When NaCl dissolves in water, the ions separate and go their own way in solution; the ions are now written with their respective charges, and the (aq) phase label emphasizes that they are dissolved (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)). This process is called dissociation; we say that the ions dissociate . All ionic compounds that dissolve behave this way. This behavior was first suggested by the Swedish chemist Svante August Arrhenius [1859–1927] as part of his PhD dissertation in 1884. Interestingly, his PhD examination team had a hard time believing that ionic compounds would behave like this, so they gave Arrhenius a barely passing grade. Later, this work was cited when Arrhenius was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Keep in mind that when the ions separate, all the ions separate. Thus, when CaCl 2 dissolves, the one Ca 2 + ion and the two Cl − ions separate from one another: \\[CaCl_{2}(s)\\overset{H_{2}O}{\\rightarrow}Ca^{2+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)\\nonumber \\] \\[CaCl_{2}(s)\\overset{H_{2}O}{\\rightarrow}Ca^{2+}(aq)+2Cl^{-}(aq)\\nonumber \\] That is, the two chloride ions go off on their own. They do not remain as Cl 2 (that would be elemental chlorine; these are chloride ions), and they do not stick together to make Cl 2 − or Cl 2 2 − . They become dissociated ions in their own right. Polyatomic ions also retain their overall identity when they are dissolved. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the chemical equation that represents the dissociation of each ionic compound. KBr Na 2 SO 4 Solution KBr(s) → K + (aq) + Br − (aq) Not only do the two sodium ions go their own way, but the sulfate ion stays together as the sulfate ion. The dissolving equation is Na 2 SO 4 (s) → 2Na + (aq) + SO 4 2 − (aq) Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the chemical equation that represents the dissociation of (NH 4 ) 2 S. Answer (NH 4 ) 2 S(s) → 2NH 4 + (aq) + S 2− (aq) When chemicals in solution react, the proper way of writing the chemical formulas of the dissolved ionic compounds is in terms of the dissociated ions, not the complete ionic formula. A complete ionic equation is a chemical equation in which the dissolved ionic compounds are written as separated ions. Solubility rules are very useful in determining which ionic compounds are dissolved and which are not. For example, when NaCl(aq) reacts with AgNO 3 (aq) in a double-replacement reaction to precipitate AgCl(s) and form NaNO 3 (aq), the complete ionic equation includes NaCl, AgNO 3 , and NaNO 3 written as separate ions: \\[\\ce{Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{−}(aq) + Ag^{+}(aq) + NO3^{−}(aq) → AgCl(s) + Na^{+}(aq) + NO3^{−}(aq)}\\nonumber \\] This is more representative of what is occurring in the solution. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the complete ionic equation for each chemical reaction. KBr(aq) + AgC 2 H 3 O 2 (aq) → KC 2 H 3 O 2 (aq) + AgBr(s) MgSO 4 (aq) + Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) → Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) + BaSO 4 (s) Solution For any ionic compound that is aqueous, we will write the compound as separated ions. The complete ionic equation is K + (aq) + Br − (aq) + Ag + (aq) + C 2 H 3 O 2 − (aq) → K + (aq) + C 2 H 3 O 2 − (aq) + AgBr(s) The complete ionic equation is Mg 2 + (aq) + SO 4 2 − (aq) + Ba 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) → Mg 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) + BaSO 4 (s) Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the complete ionic equation for \\[\\ce{CaCl2(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + PbCl2(s)}\\nonumber \\] Answer Ca 2 + (aq) + 2Cl − (aq) + Pb 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) → Ca 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) + PbCl 2 (s) You may notice that in a complete ionic equation, some ions do not change their chemical form; they stay exactly the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. For example, in Na + (aq) + Cl − (aq) + Ag + (aq) + NO 3 − (aq) → AgCl(s) + Na + (aq) + NO 3 − (aq) the Ag + (aq) and Cl − (aq) ions become AgCl(s), but the Na + (aq) ions and the NO 3 − (aq) ions stay as Na + (aq) ions and NO 3 − (aq) ions. These two ions are examples of spectator ions—ions that do nothing in the overall course of a chemical reaction. They are present, but they do not participate in the overall chemistry. It is common to cancel spectator ions (something also done with algebraic quantities) on the opposite sides of a chemical equation: \\[\\cancel{Na^{+}(aq)}+Cl^{-}(aq)+Ag^{+}(aq)+\\cancel{NO_{3}^{-}}(aq)\\rightarrow AgCl(s)+\\cancel{Na}^{+}(aq)+\\cancel{NO}_{3}^{-}(aq)\\nonumber \\] What remains when the spectator ions are removed is called the net ionic equation , which represents the actual chemical change occurring between the ionic compounds: Cl − (aq) + Ag + (aq) → AgCl(s) It is important to reiterate that the spectator ions are still present in solution, but they do not experience any net chemical change, so they are not written in a net ionic equation. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the net ionic equation for each chemical reaction.

Some ionic compounds are very soluble, some are only moderately soluble, and some are soluble so little that they are considered insoluble. For most ionic compounds, there is also a limit to the amount of compound that can be dissolved in a sample of water. For example, you can dissolve a maximum of 36.0 g of NaCl in 100 g of water at room temperature, but you can dissolve only 0.00019 g of AgCl in 100 g of water. We consider \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) soluble but \\(\\ce{AgCl}\\) insoluble. One place where solubility is important is in the tank-type water heater found in many homes in the United States. Domestic water frequently contains small amounts of dissolved ionic compounds, including calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). However, CaCO 3 has the relatively unusual property of being less soluble in hot water than in cold water. So as the water heater operates by heating water, CaCO 3 can precipitate if there is enough of it in the water. This precipitate, called limescale , can also contain magnesium compounds, hydrogen carbonate compounds, and phosphate compounds. The problem is that too much limescale can impede the function of a water heater, requiring more energy to heat water to a specific temperature or even blocking water pipes into or out of the water heater, causing dysfunction. Another place where solubility versus insolubility is an issue is the Grand Canyon. We usually think of rock as insoluble. But it is actually ever so slightly soluble. This means that over a period of about two billion years, the Colorado River carved rock from the surface by slowly dissolving it, eventually generating a spectacular series of gorges and canyons. And all because of solubility! Key Takeaways Ionic compounds that dissolve separate into individual ions. Complete ionic equations show dissolved ionic solids as separated ions. Net ionic equations show only the ions and other substances that change in a chemical reaction.",
         "Learning Objectives Write ionic equations for chemical reactions between ionic compounds. Write net ionic equations for chemical reactions between ionic compounds. For single-replacement and double-replacement reactions, many of the reactions included ionic compounds—compounds between metals and nonmetals, or compounds that contained recognizable polyatomic ions. Now, we take a closer look at reactions that include ionic compounds. One important aspect about ionic compounds that differs from molecular compounds has to do with dissolution in a liquid, such as water. When molecular compounds, such as sugar, dissolve in water, the individual molecules drift apart from each other. When ionic compounds dissolve, the ions physically separate from each other . We can use a chemical equation to represent this process—for example, with NaCl: \\[\\ce{ NaCl(s) ->[\\ce{H2O}] Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)}\\nonumber \\] When NaCl dissolves in water, the ions separate and go their own way in solution; the ions are now written with their respective charges, and the (aq) phase label emphasizes that they are dissolved (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)). This process is called dissociation; we say that the ions dissociate . All ionic compounds that dissolve behave this way. This behavior was first suggested by the Swedish chemist Svante August Arrhenius [1859–1927] as part of his PhD dissertation in 1884. Interestingly, his PhD examination team had a hard time believing that ionic compounds would behave like this, so they gave Arrhenius a barely passing grade. Later, this work was cited when Arrhenius was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Keep in mind that when the ions separate, all the ions separate. Thus, when CaCl 2 dissolves, the one Ca 2 + ion and the two Cl − ions separate from one another: \\[CaCl_{2}(s)\\overset{H_{2}O}{\\rightarrow}Ca^{2+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)\\nonumber \\] \\[CaCl_{2}(s)\\overset{H_{2}O}{\\rightarrow}Ca^{2+}(aq)+2Cl^{-}(aq)\\nonumber \\] That is, the two chloride ions go off on their own. They do not remain as Cl 2 (that would be elemental chlorine; these are chloride ions), and they do not stick together to make Cl 2 − or Cl 2 2 − . They become dissociated ions in their own right. Polyatomic ions also retain their overall identity when they are dissolved. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the chemical equation that represents the dissociation of each ionic compound. KBr Na 2 SO 4 Solution KBr(s) → K + (aq) + Br − (aq) Not only do the two sodium ions go their own way, but the sulfate ion stays together as the sulfate ion. The dissolving equation is Na 2 SO 4 (s) → 2Na + (aq) + SO 4 2 − (aq) Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the chemical equation that represents the dissociation of (NH 4 ) 2 S. Answer (NH 4 ) 2 S(s) → 2NH 4 + (aq) + S 2− (aq) When chemicals in solution react, the proper way of writing the chemical formulas of the dissolved ionic compounds is in terms of the dissociated ions, not the complete ionic formula. A complete ionic equation is a chemical equation in which the dissolved ionic compounds are written as separated ions. Solubility rules are very useful in determining which ionic compounds are dissolved and which are not. For example, when NaCl(aq) reacts with AgNO 3 (aq) in a double-replacement reaction to precipitate AgCl(s) and form NaNO 3 (aq), the complete ionic equation includes NaCl, AgNO 3 , and NaNO 3 written as separate ions: \\[\\ce{Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{−}(aq) + Ag^{+}(aq) + NO3^{−}(aq) → AgCl(s) + Na^{+}(aq) + NO3^{−}(aq)}\\nonumber \\] This is more representative of what is occurring in the solution. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the complete ionic equation for each chemical reaction. KBr(aq) + AgC 2 H 3 O 2 (aq) → KC 2 H 3 O 2 (aq) + AgBr(s) MgSO 4 (aq) + Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) → Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) + BaSO 4 (s) Solution For any ionic compound that is aqueous, we will write the compound as separated ions. The complete ionic equation is K + (aq) + Br − (aq) + Ag + (aq) + C 2 H 3 O 2 − (aq) → K + (aq) + C 2 H 3 O 2 − (aq) + AgBr(s) The complete ionic equation is Mg 2 + (aq) + SO 4 2 − (aq) + Ba 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) → Mg 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) + BaSO 4 (s) Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the complete ionic equation for \\[\\ce{CaCl2(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + PbCl2(s)}\\nonumber \\] Answer Ca 2 + (aq) + 2Cl − (aq) + Pb 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) → Ca 2 + (aq) + 2NO 3 − (aq) + PbCl 2 (s) You may notice that in a complete ionic equation, some ions do not change their chemical form; they stay exactly the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. For example, in Na + (aq) + Cl − (aq) + Ag + (aq) + NO 3 − (aq) → AgCl(s) + Na + (aq) + NO 3 − (aq) the Ag + (aq) and Cl − (aq) ions become AgCl(s), but the Na + (aq) ions and the NO 3 − (aq) ions stay as Na + (aq) ions and NO 3 − (aq) ions.

         "The Brønsted-Lowry acid-base concept The Brønsted-Lowry acid-base concept overcomes the Arrhenius system's inability to describe reactions that take place outside of aqueous solution by moving the focus away from the solution and onto the acid and base themselves. It does this by redefining acid-base reactivity as involving the transfer of a hydrogen ion, \\(H^+\\), between an acid and a base. Specifically, a Brønsted acid is a substance that loses an \\(H^+\\) ion by donating it to a base. This means that a Brønsted base is defined as a substance which accepts \\(H^+\\) from an acid when it reacts. Because the Brønsted-Lowry concept is concerned with \\(H^+\\) ion transfer rather than the creation of a particular chemical species, it is able to handle a diverse array of acid-base concepts. In fact, from the viewpoint of the Brønsted-Lowry concept, Arrhenius acids and bases are just a special case involving hydrogen ion donation and acceptance involving water. Arrhenius acids donate \\(H^+\\) ion to water, which acts as a Brønsted base in accepting it to give \\(H_3O^+\\): \\[\\label{ 6.3.1} \\] Similarly, Arrhenius bases act as Brønsted bases in accepting a hydrogen ion from the Brønsted acid water: \\[ \\nonumber \\] In this way it can be seen that Arrhenius acids and bases are defined in terms of their causing hydrogen ions to be donated to and abstracted from water, respectively, while Brønsted acids and bases are defined in terms of their ability to donate and accept hydrogen ions to and from anything. Becasue the Brønsted-Lowry concept can handle any sort of hydrogen ion transfer it readily accommodates many reactions that Arrhenius theory cannot, including those that take place outside of water, such as the reaction between gaseous hydrochloric acid and ammonia: \\[ \\nonumber \\] The classification of acids as strong or weak usually refers to their ability to donate or abstract hydrogen ions to or from water to give \\(H_3O^+\\) and \\(OH^-\\), respectively, i.e., their Arrhenius acidity and basicity. However, acids and bases may be classified as strong and weak under the Brønsted-Lowry definition based on whether they completely transfer or accept hydrogen ions; it is just that in this case it is important to specify the conditions under which a given acid or base acts strong or weak. For example, acetic acid acts as a weak acid in water but is a strong acid in triethylamine, since in the latter case it completely transfers a hydrogen ion to triethylamine to give triethylammonium acetate. Alternatively, the acidity or basicity of a compound may be specified using a thermodynamic scale like the Hammett acidity . Conjugate Acids and Bases By redefining acids and bases in terms of hydrogen ion donation and acceptance, the Brønsted-Lowry system makes it easy to recognize that when an acid loses its hydrogen ion it becomes a substance that is capable of receiving it back again, namely, a base. Consider, for example, the base dissociation of ammonia in water. When ammonia acts as a Brønsted base and receives a hydrogen ion from water, ammonium ion and hydroxide are formed: \\[ \\nonumber \\] The ammonium ion is itself a weak acid that can undergo dissociation: \\[ \\nonumber \\] In this case ammonia and ammonium ion are acid-base conjugates. In general acids and bases that differ by a single ionizable hydrogen ion are said to be conjugates of one another. The strengths of conjugates vary reciprocally with one another, so the stronger the acid the weaker the base and vice versa. For example, in water, acetic acid acts as a weak Brønsted acid: \\[ \\nonumber \\] and acetic acid's conjugate base, acetate, acts as a weak Brønsted base. \\[ \\nonumber \\] However, in liquid ammonia acetic acid acts as a strong Brønsted acid: \\[ \\nonumber \\] while its conjugate base, acetate, is neutral. \\[ \\nonumber \\] The reciprocal relationship between the strengths of acids and their conjugate bases has several consequences: Under conditions when an acid or base acts as a weak acid or base its conjugate acts as weak as well. Conversely, when an acid or base acts as a strong acid or base its conjugate acts as a neutral species. When a Brønsted acid and base react with one another, the equilibrium favors formation of the weakest acid-base pair. That is why the acid-base reaction between acetic acid and ammonia in liquid ammonia proceeded to give the weak acid ammonium ion and neutral acetate. This consequence is particularly important for understanding the behavior of acids and bases in nonaqueous solvents, as illustrated by the following example. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Can a solution of lithium diisopropylamide in heptane be used to form lithium cyclopentadienide? The \\(pK_a\\) of cyclopentadiene and diisopropylamine are ~15 and 40, respectively, and the proposed reaction is as follows: Solution: Since cyclopentadiene is a stronger acid than diisopropylamine (the stronger the acid the lower the \\(pK_a\\)) the equilibrium will favor protonation of the diisopropylamine by cyclopentadiene. Consequently addition of a heptane solution of lithium diisopropylamide to monomeric cyclopentadiene should give lithium cyclopentadienide.",

         "Learning Objectives Express a large number or a small number in scientific notation. Carry out arithmetical operations and express the final answer in scientific notation Chemists often work with numbers that are exceedingly large or small. For example, entering the mass in grams of a hydrogen atom into a calculator would require a display with at least 24 decimal places. A system called scientific notation avoids much of the tedium and awkwardness of manipulating numbers with large or small magnitudes. In scientific notation, these numbers are expressed in the form \\[ N \\times 10^n \\nonumber \\] where N is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 (1 ≤ N < 10), and n is a positive or negative integer (10 0 = 1). The number 10 is called the base because it is this number that is raised to the power \\(n\\). Although a base number may have values other than 10, the base number in scientific notation is always 10. A simple way to convert numbers to scientific notation is to move the decimal point as many places to the left or right as needed to give a number from 1 to 10 (N). The magnitude of n is then determined as follows: If the decimal point is moved to the left n places, n is positive. If the decimal point is moved to the right n places, n is negative.

         "Learning Objectives Express a large number or a small number in scientific notation. Carry out arithmetical operations and express the final answer in scientific notation Chemists often work with numbers that are exceedingly large or small. For example, entering the mass in grams of a hydrogen atom into a calculator would require a display with at least 24 decimal places. A system called scientific notation avoids much of the tedium and awkwardness of manipulating numbers with large or small magnitudes. In scientific notation, these numbers are expressed in the form \\[ N \\times 10^n \\nonumber \\] where N is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 (1 ≤ N < 10), and n is a positive or negative integer (10 0 = 1). The number 10 is called the base because it is this number that is raised to the power \\(n\\). Although a base number may have values other than 10, the base number in scientific notation is always 10. A simple way to convert numbers to scientific notation is to move the decimal point as many places to the left or right as needed to give a number from 1 to 10 (N). The magnitude of n is then determined as follows: If the decimal point is moved to the left n places, n is positive. If the decimal point is moved to the right n places, n is negative. Another way to remember this is to recognize that as the number N decreases in magnitude, the exponent increases and vice versa.

         "Learning Objectives Explain why the boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than those of ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses but lower than those of comparable alcohols. Compare the solubilities in water of aldehydes and ketones of four or fewer carbon atoms with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols. Name the typical reactions take place with aldehydes and ketones. Describe some of the uses of common aldehydes and ketones. The carbon-to-oxygen double bond is quite polar, more polar than a carbon-to-oxygen single bond. The electronegative oxygen atom has a much greater attraction for the bonding electron pairs than does the carbon atom. The carbon atom has a partial positive charge, and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge: In aldehydes and ketones, this charge separation leads to dipole-dipole interactions that are great enough to significantly affect the boiling points. Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) shows that the polar single bonds in ethers have little such effect, whereas hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules is even stronger. Compound Family Molar Mass Type of Intermolecular Forces Boiling Point (°C) CH3CH2CH2CH3 alkane 58 dispersion only –1 CH3OCH2CH3 ether 60 weak dipole 6 CH3CH2CHO aldehyde 58 strong dipole 49 CH3CH2CH2OH alcohol 60 hydrogen bonding 97 Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature. Acetaldehyde boils at 20°C; in an open vessel, it boils away in a warm room. Most other common aldehydes are liquids at room temperature. Although the lower members of the homologous series have pungent odors, many higher aldehydes have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and artificial flavorings. As for the ketones, acetone has a pleasant odor, but most of the higher homologs have rather bland odors. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group engages in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule. The solubility of aldehydes is therefore about the same as that of alcohols and ethers. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone are soluble in water. As the carbon chain increases in length, solubility in water decreases. The borderline of solubility occurs at about four carbon atoms per oxygen atom. All aldehydes and ketones are soluble in organic solvents and, in general, are less dense than water. Oxidation of Aldehydes and Ketones Aldehydes and ketones are much alike in many of their reactions, owing to the presence of the carbonyl functional group in both. They differ greatly, however, in one most important type of reaction: oxidation. Aldehydes are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas ketones resist oxidation. The aldehydes are, in fact, among the most easily oxidized of organic compounds.

Some Common Carbonyl Compounds Formaldehyde has an irritating odor. Because of its reactivity, it is difficult to handle in the gaseous state. For many uses, it is therefore dissolved in water and sold as a 37% to 40% aqueous solution called formalin . Formaldehyde denatures proteins, rendering them insoluble in water and resistant to bacterial decay. For this reason, formalin is used in embalming solutions and in preserving biological specimens. Aldehydes are the active components in many other familiar substances. Large quantities of formaldehyde are used to make phenol-formaldehyde resins for gluing the wood sheets in plywood and as adhesives in other building materials. Sometimes the formaldehyde escapes from the materials and causes health problems in some people. While some people seem unaffected, others experience coughing, wheezing, eye irritation, and other symptoms. The odor of green leaves is due in part to a carbonyl compound, cis-3-hexenal, which with related compounds is used to impart a “green” herbal odor to shampoos and other products. Acetaldehyde is an extremely volatile, colorless liquid. It is a starting material for the preparation of many other organic compounds. Acetaldehyde is formed as a metabolite in the fermentation of sugars and in the detoxification of alcohol in the liver. Aldehydes are the active components of many other familiar materials (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)). Acetone is the simplest and most important ketone. Because it is miscible with water as well as with most organic solvents, its chief use is as an industrial solvent (for example, for paints and lacquers). It is also the chief ingredient in some brands of nail polish remover. To Your Health: Acetone in Blood, Urine, and Breath Acetone is formed in the human body as a by-product of lipid metabolism. Normally, acetone does not accumulate to an appreciable extent because it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. The normal concentration of acetone in the human body is less than 1 mg/100 mL of blood. In certain disease states, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, the acetone concentration rises to higher levels. It is then excreted in the urine, where it is easily detected. In severe cases, its odor can be noted on the breath. Ketones are also the active components of other familiar substances, some of which are noted in the accompanying figure. Certain steroid hormones have the ketone functional group as a part of their structure. Two examples are progesterone, a hormone secreted by the ovaries that stimulates the growth of cells in the uterine wall and prepares it for attachment of a fertilized egg, and testosterone, the main male sex hormone. These and other sex hormones affect our development and our lives in fundamental ways. Summary The polar carbon-to-oxygen double bond causes aldehydes and ketones to have higher boiling points than those of ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses but lower than those of comparable alcohols that engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Aldehydes are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas ketones resist oxidation.",
         "Learning Objectives Explain why the boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than those of ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses but lower than those of comparable alcohols. Compare the solubilities in water of aldehydes and ketones of four or fewer carbon atoms with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols. Name the typical reactions take place with aldehydes and ketones. Describe some of the uses of common aldehydes and ketones. The carbon-to-oxygen double bond is quite polar, more polar than a carbon-to-oxygen single bond. The electronegative oxygen atom has a much greater attraction for the bonding electron pairs than does the carbon atom. The carbon atom has a partial positive charge, and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge: In aldehydes and ketones, this charge separation leads to dipole-dipole interactions that are great enough to significantly affect the boiling points. Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) shows that the polar single bonds in ethers have little such effect, whereas hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules is even stronger. Compound Family Molar Mass Type of Intermolecular Forces Boiling Point (°C) CH3CH2CH2CH3 alkane 58 dispersion only –1 CH3OCH2CH3 ether 60 weak dipole 6 CH3CH2CHO aldehyde 58 strong dipole 49 CH3CH2CH2OH alcohol 60 hydrogen bonding 97 Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature. Acetaldehyde boils at 20°C; in an open vessel, it boils away in a warm room. Most other common aldehydes are liquids at room temperature. Although the lower members of the homologous series have pungent odors, many higher aldehydes have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and artificial flavorings. As for the ketones, acetone has a pleasant odor, but most of the higher homologs have rather bland odors. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group engages in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule. The solubility of aldehydes is therefore about the same as that of alcohols and ethers. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone are soluble in water. As the carbon chain increases in length, solubility in water decreases. The borderline of solubility occurs at about four carbon atoms per oxygen atom. All aldehydes and ketones are soluble in organic solvents and, in general, are less dense than water. Oxidation of Aldehydes and Ketones Aldehydes and ketones are much alike in many of their reactions, owing to the presence of the carbonyl functional group in both. They differ greatly, however, in one most important type of reaction: oxidation. Aldehydes are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas ketones resist oxidation. The aldehydes are, in fact, among the most easily oxidized of organic compounds. They are oxidized by oxygen (\\(\\ce{O2}\\)) in air to carboxylic acids. \\[\\ce{2RCHO + O_2 -> 2RCOOH} \\nonumber \\] The ease of oxidation helps chemists identify aldehydes.

         "Learning Objectives To understand how different phases affect equilibria. When the products and reactants of an equilibrium reaction form a single phase, whether gas or liquid, the system is a homogeneous equilibrium. In such situations, the concentrations of the reactants and products can vary over a wide range. In contrast, a system whose reactants, products, or both are in more than one phase is a heterogeneous equilibrium, such as the reaction of a gas with a solid or liquid. As noted in the previous section, the equilibrium constant expression is actually a ratio of activities. To simplify the calculations in general chemistry courses, the activity of each substance in the reaction is often approximated using a ratio of the molarity of a substance compared to the standard state of that substance. For substances that are liquids or solids, the standard state is just the concentration of the substance within the liquid or solid. Because the molar concentrations of pure liquids and solids normally do not vary greatly with temperature, the ratio of the molarity to the standard state for substances that are liquids or solids always has a value of 1. For example, for a compound such as CaF 2 (s), the term going into the equilibrium expression is [CaF 2 ]/[CaF 2 ] which cancels to unity. Thus, when the activities of the solids and liquids (including solvents) are incorporated into the equilibrium expression, they do not change the value. Consider the following reaction, which is used in the final firing of some types of pottery to produce brilliant metallic glazes: \\[\\ce{CO2(g) + C(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2CO(g)} \\label{Eq14.4.1} \\] The glaze is created when metal oxides are reduced to metals by the product, carbon monoxide. The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is as follows: \\[K=\\dfrac{a_{\\ce{CO}}^2}{a_{\\ce{CO2}}a_{C}}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO2}][1]}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO_2}]}\\label{Eq14.4.2} \\] The equilibrium constant for this reaction can also be written in terms of the partial pressures of the gases: \\[K_p=\\dfrac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}} \\label{Eq14.4.3} \\] Incorporating all the constant values into \\(K′\\) or \\(K_p\\) allows us to focus on the substances whose concentrations change during the reaction. Although the activities of pure liquids or solids are not written explicitly in the equilibrium constant expression, these substances must be present in the reaction mixture for chemical equilibrium to occur. Whatever the concentrations of \\(\\ce{CO}\\) and \\(\\ce{CO_2}\\), the system described in Equation \\(\\ref{Eq14.4.1}\\) will reach chemical equilibrium only if a stoichiometric amount of solid carbon or excess solid carbon has been added so that some is still present once the system has reached equilibrium. As shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), it does not matter whether 1 g or 100 g of solid carbon is present; in either case, the composition of the gaseous components of the system will be the same at equilibrium. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write each expression for \\(K\\), incorporating all constants, and \\(K_p\\) for the following equilibrium reactions. \\(\\ce{PCl3(l) + Cl2(g) <=> PCl5(s)}\\) \\(\\ce{Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) <=> 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)}\\) Given : balanced equilibrium equations.

Solution This reaction contains a pure solid (\\(PCl_5\\)) and a pure liquid (\\(PCl_3\\)). Their activities are equal to 1, so when incorporated into the equilibrium constant expression, they do not change the value.

The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities. The result is that the equilibrium constant expressions appear to only depend upon the concentrations of the solutes. The activities of pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are defined as having a value of '1'. Often, it is said that these activities are \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. This is an unfortunate use of words. The activities are not \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. Rather, because they have a value of '1', they do not change the value of the equilibrium constant when they are multiplied together with the other terms. The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities.

         "Learning Objectives To understand how different phases affect equilibria. When the products and reactants of an equilibrium reaction form a single phase, whether gas or liquid, the system is a homogeneous equilibrium. In such situations, the concentrations of the reactants and products can vary over a wide range. In contrast, a system whose reactants, products, or both are in more than one phase is a heterogeneous equilibrium, such as the reaction of a gas with a solid or liquid. As noted in the previous section, the equilibrium constant expression is actually a ratio of activities. To simplify the calculations in general chemistry courses, the activity of each substance in the reaction is often approximated using a ratio of the molarity of a substance compared to the standard state of that substance. For substances that are liquids or solids, the standard state is just the concentration of the substance within the liquid or solid. Because the molar concentrations of pure liquids and solids normally do not vary greatly with temperature, the ratio of the molarity to the standard state for substances that are liquids or solids always has a value of 1. For example, for a compound such as CaF 2 (s), the term going into the equilibrium expression is [CaF 2 ]/[CaF 2 ] which cancels to unity.

The proteins in all living species, from bacteria to humans, are constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids, so called because each contains an amino group attached to a carboxylic acid. The amino acids in proteins are α-amino acids, which means the amino group is attached to the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid. Humans can synthesize only about half of the needed amino acids; the remainder must be obtained from the diet and are known as essential amino acids. However, two additional amino acids have been found in limited quantities in proteins: Selenocysteine was discovered in 1986, while pyrrolysine was discovered in 2002. The amino acids are colorless, nonvolatile, crystalline solids, melting and decomposing at temperatures above 200°C. These melting temperatures are more like those of inorganic salts than those of amines or organic acids and indicate that the structures of the amino acids in the solid state and in neutral solution are best represented as having both a negatively charged group and a positively charged group. Such a species is known as a zwitterion. Classification In addition to the amino and carboxyl groups, amino acids have a side chain or R group attached to the α-carbon. Each amino acid has unique characteristics arising from the size, shape, solubility, and ionization properties of its R group. As a result, the side chains of amino acids exert a profound effect on the structure and biological activity of proteins.

Draw a diagram of Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model of the atom and explain why it has this name. Describe Rutherford's gold foil experiment and explain how this experiment altered the \"plum pudding\" model. Draw a diagram of the Rutherford model of the atom and label the nucleus and the electron cloud. Dalton's Atomic Theory held up well to a lot of the different chemical experiments that scientists performed to test it. In fact, for almost 100 years, it seemed as if Dalton's Atomic Theory was the whole truth. However, in 1897, a scientist named J. J. Thomson conducted some research that suggested that Dalton's Atomic Theory was not the entire story. He suggested that the small, negatively charged particles making up the cathode ray were actually pieces of atoms. He called these pieces \"corpuscles,\" although today we know them as electrons . Thanks to his clever experiments and careful reasoning, J. J. Thomson is credited with the discovery of the electron. Electrons and Plums The electron was discovered by J. J. Thomson in 1897. The existence of protons was also known, as was the fact that atoms were neutral in charge. Since the intact atom had no net charge and the electron and proton had opposite charges, the next step after the discovery of subatomic particles was to figure out how these particles were arranged in the atom. This was a difficult task because of the incredibly small size of the atom. Therefore, scientists set out to design a model of what they believed the atom could look like. The goal of each atomic model was to accurately represent all of the experimental evidence about atoms in the simplest way possible. Following the discovery of the electron, J.J. Thomson developed what became known as the \" plum pudding \" model in 1904. Plum pudding is an English dessert similar to a blueberry muffin. In Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom, the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge like blueberries stuck into a muffin. The positive matter was thought to be jelly-like or similar to a thick soup. The electrons were somewhat mobile. As they got closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative charges, and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom. However, this model of the atom soon gave way to a new model developed by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) about five years later. Thomson did still receive many honors during his lifetime, including being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and a knighthood in 1908. Atoms and Gold In 1911, Rutherford and coworkers Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden initiated a series of groundbreaking experiments that would completely change the accepted model of the atom. They bombarded very thin sheets of gold foil with fast moving alpha particles . Alpha particles, a type of natural radioactive particle, are positively charged particles with a mass about four times that of a hydrogen atom. According to the accepted atomic model, in which an atom's mass and charge are uniformly distributed throughout the atom, the scientists expected that all of the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with only a slight deflection or none at all. Surprisingly, while most of the alpha particles were indeed not deflected, a very small percentage (about 1 in 8000 particles) bounced off the gold foil at very large angles. Some were even redirected back toward the source. No prior knowledge had prepared them for this discovery. In a famous quote, Rutherford exclaimed that it was \"as if you had fired a 15-inch [artillery] shell at a piece of tissue and it came back and hit you.\" Rutherford needed to come up with an entirely new model of the atom in order to explain his results. Because the vast majority of the alpha particles had passed through the gold, he reasoned that most of the atom was empty space. In contrast, the particles that were highly deflected must have experienced a tremendously powerful force within the atom. He concluded that all of the positive charge and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in a very small space in the atom's interior, which he called the nucleus. The nucleus is the tiny, dense, central core of the atom and is composed of protons and neutrons. Rutherford's atomic model became known as the nuclear model . In the nuclear atom, the protons and neutrons, which comprise nearly all of the mass of the atom, are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom. The electrons are distributed around the nucleus and occupy most of the volume of the atom. It is worth emphasizing just how small the nucleus is compared to the rest of the atom. If we could blow up an atom to be the size of a large professional football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a marble. Rutherford's model proved to be an important step towards a full understanding of the atom. However, it did not completely address the nature of the electrons and the way in which they occupy the vast space around the nucleus. It was not until some years later that a full understanding of the electron was achieved. This proved to be the key to understanding the chemical properties of elements. Atomic Nucleus The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The figure below shows these parts of the atom. The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! Holding it all Together Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another. So why doesn't the nucleus fly apart? An even stronger force—called the strong nuclear force —holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. Summary Atoms are the ultimate building blocks of all matter. The modern atomic theory establishes the concepts of atoms and how they compose matter. Bombardment of gold foil with alpha particles showed that some particles were deflected. The nuclear model of the atom consists of a small and dense positively charged interior surrounded by a cloud of electrons.",

This was a difficult task because of the incredibly small size of the atom. Therefore, scientists set out to design a model of what they believed the atom could look like. The goal of each atomic model was to accurately represent all of the experimental evidence about atoms in the simplest way possible. Following the discovery of the electron, J.J. Thomson developed what became known as the \" plum pudding \" model in 1904. Plum pudding is an English dessert similar to a blueberry muffin. In Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom, the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge like blueberries stuck into a muffin. The positive matter was thought to be jelly-like or similar to a thick soup. The electrons were somewhat mobile. As they got closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative charges, and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom. However, this model of the atom soon gave way to a new model developed by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) about five years later. Thomson did still receive many honors during his lifetime, including being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and a knighthood in 1908. Atoms and Gold In 1911, Rutherford and coworkers Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden initiated a series of groundbreaking experiments that would completely change the accepted model of the atom. They bombarded very thin sheets of gold foil with fast moving alpha particles . Alpha particles, a type of natural radioactive particle, are positively charged particles with a mass about four times that of a hydrogen atom. According to the accepted atomic model, in which an atom's mass and charge are uniformly distributed throughout the atom, the scientists expected that all of the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with only a slight deflection or none at all. Surprisingly, while most of the alpha particles were indeed not deflected, a very small percentage (about 1 in 8000 particles) bounced off the gold foil at very large angles. Some were even redirected back toward the source. No prior knowledge had prepared them for this discovery. In a famous quote, Rutherford exclaimed that it was \"as if you had fired a 15-inch [artillery] shell at a piece of tissue and it came back and hit you.\" Rutherford needed to come up with an entirely new model of the atom in order to explain his results. Because the vast majority of the alpha particles had passed through the gold, he reasoned that most of the atom was empty space. In contrast, the particles that were highly deflected must have experienced a tremendously powerful force within the atom. He concluded that all of the positive charge and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in a very small space in the atom's interior, which he called the nucleus. The nucleus is the tiny, dense, central core of the atom and is composed of protons and neutrons. Rutherford's atomic model became known as the nuclear model . In the nuclear atom, the protons and neutrons, which comprise nearly all of the mass of the atom, are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom. The electrons are distributed around the nucleus and occupy most of the volume of the atom. It is worth emphasizing just how small the nucleus is compared to the rest of the atom. If we could blow up an atom to be the size of a large professional football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a marble. Rutherford's model proved to be an important step towards a full understanding of the atom. However, it did not completely address the nature of the electrons and the way in which they occupy the vast space around the nucleus. It was not until some years later that a full understanding of the electron was achieved. This proved to be the key to understanding the chemical properties of elements. Atomic Nucleus The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The figure below shows these parts of the atom. The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! Holding it all Together Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another. So why doesn't the nucleus fly apart? An even stronger force—called the strong nuclear force —holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. Summary Atoms are the ultimate building blocks of all matter. The modern atomic theory establishes the concepts of atoms and how they compose matter. Bombardment of gold foil with alpha particles showed that some particles were deflected. The nuclear model of the atom consists of a small and dense positively charged interior surrounded by a cloud of electrons."

         "Learning Objectives Derive the ideal gas law from the constituent gas laws To use the ideal gas law to describe the behavior of a gas. In this module, the relationship between pressure, temperature, volume, and amount of a gas are described and how these relationships can be combined to give a general expression that describes the behavior of a gas. Deriving the Ideal Gas Law Any set of relationships between a single quantity (such as \\(V\\)) and several other variables (\\(P\\), \\(T\\), and \\(n\\)) can be combined into a single expression that describes all the relationships simultaneously. The three individual expressions were derived previously: Boyle’s law \\[V \\propto \\dfrac{1}{P} \\;\\; \\text{@ constant n and T} \\nonumber \\] Charles’s law \\[V \\propto T \\;\\; \\text{@ constant n and P} \\nonumber \\] Avogadro’s law \\[V \\propto n \\;\\; \\text{@ constant T and P} \\nonumber \\] Combining these three expressions gives \\[V \\propto \\dfrac{nT}{P} \\label{10.4.1} \\] which shows that the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of moles and the temperature and inversely proportional to the pressure. This expression can also be written as \\[V= {\\rm Cons.} \\left( \\dfrac{nT}{P} \\right) \\label{10.4.2} \\] By convention, the proportionality constant in Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.1}\\) is called the gas constant, which is represented by the letter \\(R\\). Inserting R into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.2}\\) gives \\[ V = \\dfrac{RnT}{P} = \\dfrac{nRT}{P} \\label{10.4.3} \\] Clearing the fractions by multiplying both sides of Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\) by \\(P\\) gives \\[PV = nRT \\label{10.4.4} \\] This equation is known as the ideal gas law . An ideal gas is defined as a hypothetical gaseous substance whose behavior is independent of attractive and repulsive forces and can be completely described by the ideal gas law. In reality, there is no such thing as an ideal gas, but an ideal gas is a useful conceptual model that allows us to understand how gases respond to changing conditions. As we shall see, under many conditions, most real gases exhibit behavior that closely approximates that of an ideal gas. The ideal gas law can therefore be used to predict the behavior of real gases under most conditions. The ideal gas law does not work well at very low temperatures or very high pressures, where deviations from ideal behavior are most commonly observed. Significant deviations from ideal gas behavior commonly occur at low temperatures and very high pressures. Before we can use the ideal gas law, however, we need to know the value of the gas constant R. Its form depends on the units used for the other quantities in the expression. If V is expressed in liters (L), P in atmospheres (atm), T in kelvins (K), and n in moles (mol), then \\[R = 0.08206 \\dfrac{\\rm L\\cdot atm}{\\rm K\\cdot mol} \\label{10.4.5} \\] Because the product PV has the units of energy, R can also have units of J/(K•mol): \\[R = 8.3145 \\dfrac{\\rm J}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}\\label{10.4.6} \\] Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure Scientists have chosen a particular set of conditions to use as a reference: 0°C (273.15 K) and \\(\\rm1\\; bar = 100 \\;kPa = 10^5\\;Pa\\) pressure, referred to as standard temperature and pressure ( STP ). \\[\\text{STP:} \\hspace{2cm} T=273.15\\;{\\rm K}\\text{ and }P=\\rm 1\\;bar=10^5\\;Pa \\nonumber \\] Please note that STP was defined differently in the past. The old definition was based on a standard pressure of 1 atm. We can calculate the volume of 1.000 mol of an ideal gas under standard conditions using the variant of the ideal gas law given in Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\): \\[V=\\dfrac{nRT}{P}\\label{10.4.7} \\] Thus the volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas is 22.71 L at STP and 22.41 L at 0°C and 1 atm , approximately equivalent to the volume of three basketballs. The molar volumes of several real gases at 0°C and 1 atm​ are given in Table 10.3, which shows that the deviations from ideal gas behavior are quite small. Thus the ideal gas law does a good job of approximating the behavior of real gases at 0°C and 1 atm​. The relationships described in Section 10.3 as Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Avogadro’s laws are simply special cases of the ideal gas law in which two of the four parameters (P, V, T, and n) are held fixed. Gas Molar Volume (L) He 22.434 Ar 22.397 H2 22.433 N2 22.402 O2 22.397 CO2 22.260 NH3 22.079 Applying the Ideal Gas Law The ideal gas law allows us to calculate the value of the fourth variable for a gaseous sample if we know the values of any three of the four variables ( P , V , T , and n ). It also allows us to predict the final state of a sample of a gas (i.e., its final temperature, pressure, volume, and amount) following any changes in conditions if the parameters ( P , V , T , and n ) are specified for an initial state. Some applications are illustrated in the following examples. The approach used throughout is always to start with the same equation—the ideal gas law—and then determine which quantities are given and which need to be calculated. Let’s begin with simple cases in which we are given three of the four parameters needed for a complete physical description of a gaseous sample. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) The balloon that Charles used for his initial flight in 1783 was destroyed, but we can estimate that its volume was 31,150 L (1100 ft 3 ), given the dimensions recorded at the time. If the temperature at ground level was 86°F (30°C) and the atmospheric pressure was 745 mmHg, how many moles of hydrogen gas were needed to fill the balloon? Given: volume, temperature, and pressure Asked for: amount of gas Strategy: Solve the ideal gas law for the unknown quantity, in this case n . Make sure that all quantities are given in units that are compatible with the units of the gas constant. If necessary, convert them to the appropriate units, insert them into the equation you have derived, and then calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas needed. Solution: A We are given values for P , T , and V and asked to calculate n . If we solve the ideal gas law (Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\)) for \\(n\\), we obtain \\[\\rm745\\;mmHg\\times\\dfrac{1\\;atm}{760\\;mmHg}=0.980\\;atm \\nonumber \\] B P and T are given in units that are not compatible with the units of the gas constant [ R = 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol)]. We must therefore convert the temperature to kelvins and the pressure to atmospheres: \\[T=273+30=303{\\rm K}\\nonumber \\] Substituting these values into the expression we derived for n , we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} n &=\\dfrac{PV}{RT} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm\\dfrac{0.980\\;atm\\times31150\\;L}{0.08206\\dfrac{atm\\cdot L}{\\rm mol\\cdot K}\\times 303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=1.23\\times10^3\\;mol \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Suppose that an “empty” aerosol spray-paint can has a volume of 0.406 L and contains 0.025 mol of a propellant gas such as CO 2 . What is the pressure of the gas at 25°C? Answer 1.5 atm In Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), we were given three of the four parameters needed to describe a gas under a particular set of conditions, and we were asked to calculate the fourth. We can also use the ideal gas law to calculate the effect of changes in any of the specified conditions on any of the other parameters, as shown in Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\). General Gas Equation When a gas is described under two different conditions, the ideal gas equation must be applied twice - to an initial condition and a final condition. This is: \\[\\begin{array}{cc}\\text{Initial condition }(i) & \\text{Final condition} (f) \\\\ P_iV_i=n_iRT_i & P_fV_f=n_fRT_f\\end{array} \\nonumber \\] Both equations can be rearranged to give: \\[R=\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i} \\hspace{1cm} R=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f} \\nonumber \\] The two equations are equal to each other since each is equal to the same constant \\(R\\). Therefore, we have: \\[\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f}\\label{10.4.8} \\] The equation is called the general gas equation . The equation is particularly useful when one or two of the gas properties are held constant between the two conditions. In such cases, the equation can be simplified by eliminating these constant gas properties. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) Suppose that Charles had changed his plans and carried out his initial flight not in August but on a cold day in January, when the temperature at ground level was −10°C (14°F). How large a balloon would he have needed to contain the same amount of hydrogen gas at the same pressure as in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)? Given: temperature, pressure, amount, and volume in August; temperature in January Asked for: volume in January Strategy: Use the results from Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) for August as the initial conditions and then calculate the change in volume due to the change in temperature from 30°C to −10°C. Begin by constructing a table showing the initial and final conditions. Simplify the general gas equation by eliminating the quantities that are held constant between the initial and final conditions, in this case \\(P\\) and \\(n\\). Solve for the unknown parameter. Solution: A To see exactly which parameters have changed and which are constant, prepare a table of the initial and final conditions: Initial (August) Final (January) \\(T_i=30\\, °C = 303\\, K\\) \\(T_f=​−10\\,°C = 263\\, K\\) \\(P_i= 0.980 \\, atm\\) \\(P_f= 0.980\\, atm\\) \\(n_i=1.23 × 10^3\\, mol\\) \\(n_f= 1.23 × 10^3\\, mol\\) \\(V_i=31150\\, L\\) \\(V_f=?\\) B Both \\(n\\) and \\(P\\) are the same in both cases​ (\\(n_i=n_f,P_i=P_f\\)). Therefore, Equation \\ref{10.4.8} can be simplified to: \\[\\dfrac{V_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{V_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] This is the relationship first noted by Charles. C ​Solving the equation for \\(V_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} V_f &=V_i\\times\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm31150\\;L\\times\\dfrac{263\\;K}{303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=2.70\\times10^4\\;L \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] It is important to check your answer to be sure that it makes sense, just in case you have accidentally inverted a quantity or multiplied rather than divided. In this case, the temperature of the gas decreases. Because we know that gas volume decreases with decreasing temperature, the final volume must be less than the initial volume, so the answer makes sense. We could have calculated the new volume by plugging all the given numbers into the ideal gas law, but it is generally much easier and faster to focus on only the quantities that change. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) At a laboratory party, a helium-filled balloon with a volume of 2.00 L at 22°C is dropped into a large container of liquid nitrogen (T = −196°C). What is the final volume of the gas in the balloon? Answer 0.52 L Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) illustrates the relationship originally observed by Charles. We could work through similar examples illustrating the inverse relationship between pressure and volume noted by Boyle ( PV = constant) and the relationship between volume and amount observed by Avogadro ( V / n = constant). We will not do so, however, because it is more important to note that the historically important gas laws are only special cases of the ideal gas law in which two quantities are varied while the other two remain fixed. The method used in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) can be applied in any such case, as we demonstrate in Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) (which also shows why heating a closed container of a gas, such as a butane lighter cartridge or an aerosol can, may cause an explosion). Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Aerosol cans are prominently labeled with a warning such as “Do not incinerate this container when empty.” Assume that you did not notice this warning and tossed the “empty” aerosol can in Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) (0.025 mol in 0.406 L, initially at 25°C and 1.5 atm internal pressure) into a fire at 750°C. What would be the pressure inside the can (if it did not explode)? Given: initial volume, amount, temperature, and pressure; final temperature Asked for: final pressure Strategy: Follow the strategy outlined in Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\). Solution: Prepare a table to determine which parameters change and which are held constant: Initial Final \\(V_i=0.406\\;\\rm L\\) \\(V_f=0.406\\;\\rm L\\) \\(n_i=0.025\\;\\rm mol\\) \\(n_f=0.025\\;\\rm mol\\) \\(T_i=\\rm25\\;^\\circ C=298\\;K\\) \\(T_i=\\rm750\\;^\\circ C=1023\\;K\\) \\(P_i=1.5\\;\\rm atm\\) \\(P_f=?\\) Both \\(V\\) and \\(n\\) are the same in both cases​ (\\(V_i=V_f,n_i=n_f\\)). Therefore, Equation can be simplified to: \\[ \\dfrac{P_i}{T_i} = \\dfrac{P_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] By solving the equation for \\(P_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} P_f &=P_i\\times\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm1.5\\;atm\\times\\dfrac{1023\\;K}{298\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=5.1\\;atm \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] This pressure is more than enough to rupture a thin sheet metal container and cause an explosion! Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Suppose that a fire extinguisher, filled with CO 2 to a pressure of 20.0 atm at 21°C at the factory, is accidentally left in the sun in a closed automobile in Tucson, Arizona, in July. The interior temperature of the car rises to 160°F (71.1°C). What is the internal pressure in the fire extinguisher? Answer 23.4 atm In Examples \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) and \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) , two of the four parameters ( P , V , T , and n ) were fixed while one was allowed to vary, and we were interested in the effect on the value of the fourth. In fact, we often encounter cases where two of the variables P , V , and T are allowed to vary for a given sample of gas (hence n is constant), and we are interested in the change in the value of the third under the new conditions. Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) We saw in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) that Charles used a balloon with a volume of 31,150 L for his initial ascent and that the balloon contained 1.23 × 10 3 mol of H 2 gas initially at 30°C and 745 mmHg. Suppose that Gay-Lussac had also used this balloon for his record-breaking ascent to 23,000 ft and that the pressure and temperature at that altitude were 312 mmHg and −30°C, respectively. To what volume would the balloon have had to expand to hold the same amount of hydrogen gas at the higher altitude? Given: initial pressure, temperature, amount, and volume; final pressure and temperature Asked for: final volume Strategy: Follow the strategy outlined in Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\). Solution: Begin by setting up a table of the two sets of conditions: Initial Final \\(P_i=745\\;\\rm mmHg=0.980\\;atm\\) \\(P_f=312\\;\\rm mmHg=0.411\\;atm\\) \\(T_i=\\rm30\\;^\\circ C=303\\;K\\) \\(T_f=\\rm750-30\\;^\\circ C=243\\;K\\) \\(n_i=\\rm1.2\\times10^3\\;mol\\) \\(n_i=\\rm1.2\\times10^3\\;mol\\) \\(V_i=\\rm31150\\;L\\) \\(V_f=?\\) By eliminating the constant property (\\(n\\)) of the gas, Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.8}\\) is simplified to: \\[\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] By solving the equation for \\(V_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} V_f &=V_i\\times\\dfrac{P_i}{P_f}\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm3.115\\times10^4\\;L\\times\\dfrac{0.980\\;atm}{0.411\\;atm}\\dfrac{243\\;K}{303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=5.96\\times10^4\\;L \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] Does this answer make sense? Two opposing factors are at work in this problem: decreasing the pressure tends to increase the volume of the gas, while decreasing the temperature tends to decrease the volume of the gas. Which do we expect to predominate? The pressure drops by more than a factor of two, while the absolute temperature drops by only about 20%. Because the volume of a gas sample is directly proportional to both T and 1/ P , the variable that changes the most will have the greatest effect on V . In this case, the effect of decreasing pressure predominates, and we expect the volume of the gas to increase, as we found in our calculation. We could also have solved this problem by solving the ideal gas law for V and then substituting the relevant parameters for an altitude of 23,000 ft: Except for a difference caused by rounding to the last significant figure, this is the same result we obtained previously. There is often more than one “right” way to solve chemical problems. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) A steel cylinder of compressed argon with a volume of 0.400 L was filled to a pressure of 145 atm at 10°C. At 1.00 atm pressure and 25°C, how many 15.0 mL incandescent light bulbs could be filled from this cylinder? (Hint: find the number of moles of argon in each container.) Answer 4.07 × 10 3 Using the Ideal Gas Law to Calculate Gas Densities and Molar Masses The ideal gas law can also be used to calculate molar masses of gases from experimentally measured gas densities. To see how this is possible, we first rearrange the ideal gas law to obtain \\[\\dfrac{n}{V}=\\dfrac{P}{RT}\\label{10.4.9} \\] The left side has the units of moles per unit volume (mol/L). The number of moles of a substance equals its mass (\\(m\\), in grams) divided by its molar mass (\\(M\\), in grams per mole): \\[n=\\dfrac{m}{M}\\label{10.4.10} \\] Substituting this expression for \\(n\\) into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.9}\\) gives \\[\\dfrac{m}{MV}=\\dfrac{P}{RT}\\label{10.4.11} \\] Because \\(m/V\\) is the density \\(d\\) of a substance, we can replace \\(m/V\\) by \\(d\\) and rearrange to give \\[\\rho=\\dfrac{m}{V}=\\dfrac{MP}{RT}\\label{10.4.12} \\] The distance between particles in gases is large compared to the size of the particles, so their densities are much lower than the densities of liquids and solids. Consequently, gas density is usually measured in grams per liter (g/L) rather than grams per milliliter (g/mL). Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) Calculate the density of butane at 25°C and a pressure of 750 mmHg. Given: compound, temperature, and pressure Asked for: density Strategy: Calculate the molar mass of butane and convert all quantities to appropriate units for the value of the gas constant. Substitute these values into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) to obtain the density. Solution: A The molar mass of butane (C 4 H 10 ) is \\[M=(4)(12.011) + (10)(1.0079) = 58.123 \\rm g/mol \\nonumber \\] Using 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol) for R means that we need to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvins ( T = 25 + 273 = 298 K) and the pressure from millimeters of mercury to atmospheres: \\[P=\\rm750\\;mmHg\\times\\dfrac{1\\;atm}{760\\;mmHg}=0.987\\;atm \\nonumber \\] B Substituting these values into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) gives \\[\\rho=\\rm\\dfrac{58.123\\;g/mol\\times0.987\\;atm}{0.08206\\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{K\\cdot mol}\\times298\\;K}=2.35\\;g/L \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Density of Radon Radon (Rn) is a radioactive gas formed by the decay of naturally occurring uranium in rocks such as granite. It tends to collect in the basements of houses and poses a significant health risk if present in indoor air. Many states now require that houses be tested for radon before they are sold. Calculate the density of radon at 1.00 atm pressure and 20°C and compare it with the density of nitrogen gas, which constitutes 80% of the atmosphere, under the same conditions to see why radon is found in basements rather than in attics. Answer radon, 9.23 g/L; N 2 , 1.17 g/L A common use of Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) is to determine the molar mass of an unknown gas by measuring its density at a known temperature and pressure. This method is particularly useful in identifying a gas that has been produced in a reaction, and it is not difficult to carry out. A flask or glass bulb of known volume is carefully dried, evacuated, sealed, and weighed empty. It is then filled with a sample of a gas at a known temperature and pressure and reweighed. The difference in mass between the two readings is the mass of the gas. The volume of the flask is usually determined by weighing the flask when empty and when filled with a liquid of known density such as water. The use of density measurements to calculate molar masses is illustrated in Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\). Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) The reaction of a copper penny with nitric acid results in the formation of a red-brown gaseous compound containing nitrogen and oxygen. A sample of the gas at a pressure of 727 mmHg and a temperature of 18°C weighs 0.289 g in a flask with a volume of 157.0 mL. Calculate the molar mass of the gas and suggest a reasonable chemical formula for the compound. Given: pressure, temperature, mass, and volume Asked for: molar mass and chemical formula Strategy: Solve Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) for the molar mass of the gas and then calculate the density of the gas from the information given. Convert all known quantities to the appropriate units for the gas constant being used. Substitute the known values into your equation and solve for the molar mass. Propose a reasonable empirical formula using the atomic masses of nitrogen and oxygen and the calculated molar mass of the gas. Solution: A Solving Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) for the molar mass gives \\[M=\\dfrac{mRT}{PV}=\\dfrac{dRT}{P} \\nonumber \\] Density is the mass of the gas divided by its volume: \\[\\rho=\\dfrac{m}{V}=\\dfrac{0.289\\rm g}{0.157\\rm L}=1.84 \\rm g/L\\nonumber \\] B We must convert the other quantities to the appropriate units before inserting them into the equation: \\[T=18+273=291 K\\nonumber \\] \\[P=727 \\, mmHg \\times \\dfrac{1\\rm atm} {760\\rm mmHg} =0.957\\rm atm \\nonumber \\] The molar mass of the unknown gas is thus \\[M=\\rm\\dfrac{1.84\\;g/L\\times0.08206\\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{K\\cdot mol}\\times291\\;K}{0.957\\;atm}=45.9 g/mol\\nonumber \\] C The atomic masses of N and O are approximately 14 and 16, respectively, so we can construct a list showing the masses of possible combinations: \\[M({\\rm NO})=14 + 16=30 \\rm\\; g/mol\\nonumber \\] \\[M({\\rm N_2O})=(2)(14)+16=44 \\rm\\;g/mol\\nonumber \\] \\[M({\\rm NO_2})=14+(2)(16)=46 \\rm\\;g/mol\\nonumber \\] The most likely choice is NO 2 which is in agreement with the data. The red-brown color of smog also results from the presence of NO 2 gas. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) You are in charge of interpreting the data from an unmanned space probe that has just landed on Venus and sent back a report on its atmosphere. The data are as follows: pressure, 90 atm; temperature, 557°C; density, 58 g/L. The major constituent of the atmosphere (>95%) is carbon. Calculate the molar mass of the major gas present and identify it. Answer 44 g/mol; \\(CO_2\\) Summary The ideal gas law is derived from empirical relationships among the pressure, the volume, the temperature, and the number of moles of a gas; it can be used to calculate any of the four properties if the other three are known. Ideal gas equation : \\(PV = nRT\\), where \\(R = 0.08206 \\dfrac{\\rm L\\cdot atm}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}=8.3145 \\dfrac{\\rm J}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}\\) General gas equation : \\(\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f}\\) Density of a gas: \\(\\rho=\\dfrac{MP}{RT}\\) The empirical relationships among the volume, the temperature, the pressure, and the amount of a gas can be combined into the ideal gas law , PV = nRT . The proportionality constant, R , is called the gas constant and has the value 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol), 8.3145 J/(K•mol), or 1.9872 cal/(K•mol), depending on the units used. The ideal gas law describes the behavior of an ideal gas , a hypothetical substance whose behavior can be explained quantitatively by the ideal gas law and the kinetic molecular theory of gases. Standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 0°C and 1 atm. The volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas at STP is 22.41 L, the standard molar volume . All of the empirical gas relationships are special cases of the ideal gas law in which two of the four parameters are held constant. The ideal gas law allows us to calculate the value of the fourth quantity ( P , V , T , or n ) needed to describe a gaseous sample when the others are known and also predict the value of these quantities following a change in conditions if the original conditions (values of P , V , T , and n ) are known. The ideal gas law can also be used to calculate the density of a gas if its molar mass is known or, conversely, the molar mass of an unknown gas sample if its density is measured.",
         "Learning Objectives Derive the ideal gas law from the constituent gas laws To use the ideal gas law to describe the behavior of a gas. In this module, the relationship between pressure, temperature, volume, and amount of a gas are described and how these relationships can be combined to give a general expression that describes the behavior of a gas. Deriving the Ideal Gas Law Any set of relationships between a single quantity (such as \\(V\\)) and several other variables (\\(P\\), \\(T\\), and \\(n\\)) can be combined into a single expression that describes all the relationships simultaneously. The three individual expressions were derived previously: Boyle’s law \\[V \\propto \\dfrac{1}{P} \\;\\; \\text{@ constant n and T} \\nonumber \\] Charles’s law \\[V \\propto T \\;\\; \\text{@ constant n and P} \\nonumber \\] Avogadro’s law \\[V \\propto n \\;\\; \\text{@ constant T and P} \\nonumber \\] Combining these three expressions gives \\[V \\propto \\dfrac{nT}{P} \\label{10.4.1} \\] which shows that the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of moles and the temperature and inversely proportional to the pressure. This expression can also be written as \\[V= {\\rm Cons.} \\left( \\dfrac{nT}{P} \\right) \\label{10.4.2} \\] By convention, the proportionality constant in Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.1}\\) is called the gas constant, which is represented by the letter \\(R\\). Inserting R into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.2}\\) gives \\[ V = \\dfrac{RnT}{P} = \\dfrac{nRT}{P} \\label{10.4.3} \\] Clearing the fractions by multiplying both sides of Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\) by \\(P\\) gives \\[PV = nRT \\label{10.4.4} \\] This equation is known as the ideal gas law . An ideal gas is defined as a hypothetical gaseous substance whose behavior is independent of attractive and repulsive forces and can be completely described by the ideal gas law. In reality, there is no such thing as an ideal gas, but an ideal gas is a useful conceptual model that allows us to understand how gases respond to changing conditions. As we shall see, under many conditions, most real gases exhibit behavior that closely approximates that of an ideal gas. The ideal gas law can therefore be used to predict the behavior of real gases under most conditions. The ideal gas law does not work well at very low temperatures or very high pressures, where deviations from ideal behavior are most commonly observed. Significant deviations from ideal gas behavior commonly occur at low temperatures and very high pressures. Before we can use the ideal gas law, however, we need to know the value of the gas constant R. Its form depends on the units used for the other quantities in the expression. If V is expressed in liters (L), P in atmospheres (atm), T in kelvins (K), and n in moles (mol), then \\[R = 0.08206 \\dfrac{\\rm L\\cdot atm}{\\rm K\\cdot mol} \\label{10.4.5} \\] Because the product PV has the units of energy, R can also have units of J/(K•mol): \\[R = 8.3145 \\dfrac{\\rm J}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}\\label{10.4.6} \\] Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure Scientists have chosen a particular set of conditions to use as a reference: 0°C (273.15 K) and \\(\\rm1\\; bar = 100 \\;kPa = 10^5\\;Pa\\) pressure, referred to as standard temperature and pressure ( STP ). \\[\\text{STP:} \\hspace{2cm} T=273.15\\;{\\rm K}\\text{ and }P=\\rm 1\\;bar=10^5\\;Pa \\nonumber \\] Please note that STP was defined differently in the past. The old definition was based on a standard pressure of 1 atm. We can calculate the volume of 1.000 mol of an ideal gas under standard conditions using the variant of the ideal gas law given in Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\): \\[V=\\dfrac{nRT}{P}\\label{10.4.7} \\] Thus the volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas is 22.71 L at STP and 22.41 L at 0°C and 1 atm , approximately equivalent to the volume of three basketballs. The molar volumes of several real gases at 0°C and 1 atm​ are given in Table 10.3, which shows that the deviations from ideal gas behavior are quite small. Thus the ideal gas law does a good job of approximating the behavior of real gases at 0°C and 1 atm​. The relationships described in Section 10.3 as Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Avogadro’s laws are simply special cases of the ideal gas law in which two of the four parameters (P, V, T, and n) are held fixed. Gas Molar Volume (L) He 22.434 Ar 22.397 H2 22.433 N2 22.402 O2 22.397 CO2 22.260 NH3 22.079 Applying the Ideal Gas Law The ideal gas law allows us to calculate the value of the fourth variable for a gaseous sample if we know the values of any three of the four variables ( P , V , T , and n ). It also allows us to predict the final state of a sample of a gas (i.e., its final temperature, pressure, volume, and amount) following any changes in conditions if the parameters ( P , V , T , and n ) are specified for an initial state. Some applications are illustrated in the following examples. The approach used throughout is always to start with the same equation—the ideal gas law—and then determine which quantities are given and which need to be calculated. Let’s begin with simple cases in which we are given three of the four parameters needed for a complete physical description of a gaseous sample. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) The balloon that Charles used for his initial flight in 1783 was destroyed, but we can estimate that its volume was 31,150 L (1100 ft 3 ), given the dimensions recorded at the time. If the temperature at ground level was 86°F (30°C) and the atmospheric pressure was 745 mmHg, how many moles of hydrogen gas were needed to fill the balloon? Given: volume, temperature, and pressure Asked for: amount of gas Strategy: Solve the ideal gas law for the unknown quantity, in this case n . Make sure that all quantities are given in units that are compatible with the units of the gas constant. If necessary, convert them to the appropriate units, insert them into the equation you have derived, and then calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas needed. Solution: A We are given values for P , T , and V and asked to calculate n . If we solve the ideal gas law (Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.4}\\)) for \\(n\\), we obtain \\[\\rm745\\;mmHg\\times\\dfrac{1\\;atm}{760\\;mmHg}=0.980\\;atm \\nonumber \\] B P and T are given in units that are not compatible with the units of the gas constant [ R = 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol)]. We must therefore convert the temperature to kelvins and the pressure to atmospheres: \\[T=273+30=303{\\rm K}\\nonumber \\] Substituting these values into the expression we derived for n , we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} n &=\\dfrac{PV}{RT} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm\\dfrac{0.980\\;atm\\times31150\\;L}{0.08206\\dfrac{atm\\cdot L}{\\rm mol\\cdot K}\\times 303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=1.23\\times10^3\\;mol \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Suppose that an “empty” aerosol spray-paint can has a volume of 0.406 L and contains 0.025 mol of a propellant gas such as CO 2 . What is the pressure of the gas at 25°C? Answer 1.5 atm In Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), we were given three of the four parameters needed to describe a gas under a particular set of conditions, and we were asked to calculate the fourth. We can also use the ideal gas law to calculate the effect of changes in any of the specified conditions on any of the other parameters, as shown in Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\). General Gas Equation When a gas is described under two different conditions, the ideal gas equation must be applied twice - to an initial condition and a final condition. This is: \\[\\begin{array}{cc}\\text{Initial condition }(i) & \\text{Final condition} (f) \\\\ P_iV_i=n_iRT_i & P_fV_f=n_fRT_f\\end{array} \\nonumber \\] Both equations can be rearranged to give: \\[R=\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i} \\hspace{1cm} R=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f} \\nonumber \\] The two equations are equal to each other since each is equal to the same constant \\(R\\). Therefore, we have: \\[\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f}\\label{10.4.8} \\] The equation is called the general gas equation . The equation is particularly useful when one or two of the gas properties are held constant between the two conditions. In such cases, the equation can be simplified by eliminating these constant gas properties. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) Suppose that Charles had changed his plans and carried out his initial flight not in August but on a cold day in January, when the temperature at ground level was −10°C (14°F). How large a balloon would he have needed to contain the same amount of hydrogen gas at the same pressure as in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)? Given: temperature, pressure, amount, and volume in August; temperature in January Asked for: volume in January Strategy: Use the results from Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) for August as the initial conditions and then calculate the change in volume due to the change in temperature from 30°C to −10°C. Begin by constructing a table showing the initial and final conditions. Simplify the general gas equation by eliminating the quantities that are held constant between the initial and final conditions, in this case \\(P\\) and \\(n\\). Solve for the unknown parameter. Solution: A To see exactly which parameters have changed and which are constant, prepare a table of the initial and final conditions: Initial (August) Final (January) \\(T_i=30\\, °C = 303\\, K\\) \\(T_f=​−10\\,°C = 263\\, K\\) \\(P_i= 0.980 \\, atm\\) \\(P_f= 0.980\\, atm\\) \\(n_i=1.23 × 10^3\\, mol\\) \\(n_f= 1.23 × 10^3\\, mol\\) \\(V_i=31150\\, L\\) \\(V_f=?\\) B Both \\(n\\) and \\(P\\) are the same in both cases​ (\\(n_i=n_f,P_i=P_f\\)). Therefore, Equation \\ref{10.4.8} can be simplified to: \\[\\dfrac{V_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{V_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] This is the relationship first noted by Charles. C ​Solving the equation for \\(V_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} V_f &=V_i\\times\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm31150\\;L\\times\\dfrac{263\\;K}{303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=2.70\\times10^4\\;L \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] It is important to check your answer to be sure that it makes sense, just in case you have accidentally inverted a quantity or multiplied rather than divided. In this case, the temperature of the gas decreases. Because we know that gas volume decreases with decreasing temperature, the final volume must be less than the initial volume, so the answer makes sense. We could have calculated the new volume by plugging all the given numbers into the ideal gas law, but it is generally much easier and faster to focus on only the quantities that change. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) At a laboratory party, a helium-filled balloon with a volume of 2.00 L at 22°C is dropped into a large container of liquid nitrogen (T = −196°C). What is the final volume of the gas in the balloon? Answer 0.52 L Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) illustrates the relationship originally observed by Charles. We could work through similar examples illustrating the inverse relationship between pressure and volume noted by Boyle ( PV = constant) and the relationship between volume and amount observed by Avogadro ( V / n = constant). We will not do so, however, because it is more important to note that the historically important gas laws are only special cases of the ideal gas law in which two quantities are varied while the other two remain fixed. The method used in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) can be applied in any such case, as we demonstrate in Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) (which also shows why heating a closed container of a gas, such as a butane lighter cartridge or an aerosol can, may cause an explosion). Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Aerosol cans are prominently labeled with a warning such as “Do not incinerate this container when empty.” Assume that you did not notice this warning and tossed the “empty” aerosol can in Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) (0.025 mol in 0.406 L, initially at 25°C and 1.5 atm internal pressure) into a fire at 750°C. What would be the pressure inside the can (if it did not explode)? Given: initial volume, amount, temperature, and pressure; final temperature Asked for: final pressure Strategy: Follow the strategy outlined in Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\). Solution: Prepare a table to determine which parameters change and which are held constant: Initial Final \\(V_i=0.406\\;\\rm L\\) \\(V_f=0.406\\;\\rm L\\) \\(n_i=0.025\\;\\rm mol\\) \\(n_f=0.025\\;\\rm mol\\) \\(T_i=\\rm25\\;^\\circ C=298\\;K\\) \\(T_i=\\rm750\\;^\\circ C=1023\\;K\\) \\(P_i=1.5\\;\\rm atm\\) \\(P_f=?\\) Both \\(V\\) and \\(n\\) are the same in both cases​ (\\(V_i=V_f,n_i=n_f\\)). Therefore, Equation can be simplified to: \\[ \\dfrac{P_i}{T_i} = \\dfrac{P_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] By solving the equation for \\(P_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} P_f &=P_i\\times\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm1.5\\;atm\\times\\dfrac{1023\\;K}{298\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=5.1\\;atm \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] This pressure is more than enough to rupture a thin sheet metal container and cause an explosion! Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Suppose that a fire extinguisher, filled with CO 2 to a pressure of 20.0 atm at 21°C at the factory, is accidentally left in the sun in a closed automobile in Tucson, Arizona, in July. The interior temperature of the car rises to 160°F (71.1°C). What is the internal pressure in the fire extinguisher? Answer 23.4 atm In Examples \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) and \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) , two of the four parameters ( P , V , T , and n ) were fixed while one was allowed to vary, and we were interested in the effect on the value of the fourth. In fact, we often encounter cases where two of the variables P , V , and T are allowed to vary for a given sample of gas (hence n is constant), and we are interested in the change in the value of the third under the new conditions. Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) We saw in Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) that Charles used a balloon with a volume of 31,150 L for his initial ascent and that the balloon contained 1.23 × 10 3 mol of H 2 gas initially at 30°C and 745 mmHg. Suppose that Gay-Lussac had also used this balloon for his record-breaking ascent to 23,000 ft and that the pressure and temperature at that altitude were 312 mmHg and −30°C, respectively. To what volume would the balloon have had to expand to hold the same amount of hydrogen gas at the higher altitude? Given: initial pressure, temperature, amount, and volume; final pressure and temperature Asked for: final volume Strategy: Follow the strategy outlined in Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\). Solution: Begin by setting up a table of the two sets of conditions: Initial Final \\(P_i=745\\;\\rm mmHg=0.980\\;atm\\) \\(P_f=312\\;\\rm mmHg=0.411\\;atm\\) \\(T_i=\\rm30\\;^\\circ C=303\\;K\\) \\(T_f=\\rm750-30\\;^\\circ C=243\\;K\\) \\(n_i=\\rm1.2\\times10^3\\;mol\\) \\(n_i=\\rm1.2\\times10^3\\;mol\\) \\(V_i=\\rm31150\\;L\\) \\(V_f=?\\) By eliminating the constant property (\\(n\\)) of the gas, Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.8}\\) is simplified to: \\[\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{T_f} \\nonumber \\] By solving the equation for \\(V_f\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align*} V_f &=V_i\\times\\dfrac{P_i}{P_f}\\dfrac{T_f}{T_i} \\\\[4pt] &=\\rm3.115\\times10^4\\;L\\times\\dfrac{0.980\\;atm}{0.411\\;atm}\\dfrac{243\\;K}{303\\;K} \\\\[4pt] &=5.96\\times10^4\\;L \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\] Does this answer make sense? Two opposing factors are at work in this problem: decreasing the pressure tends to increase the volume of the gas, while decreasing the temperature tends to decrease the volume of the gas. Which do we expect to predominate? The pressure drops by more than a factor of two, while the absolute temperature drops by only about 20%. Because the volume of a gas sample is directly proportional to both T and 1/ P , the variable that changes the most will have the greatest effect on V . In this case, the effect of decreasing pressure predominates, and we expect the volume of the gas to increase, as we found in our calculation. We could also have solved this problem by solving the ideal gas law for V and then substituting the relevant parameters for an altitude of 23,000 ft: Except for a difference caused by rounding to the last significant figure, this is the same result we obtained previously. There is often more than one “right” way to solve chemical problems. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) A steel cylinder of compressed argon with a volume of 0.400 L was filled to a pressure of 145 atm at 10°C. At 1.00 atm pressure and 25°C, how many 15.0 mL incandescent light bulbs could be filled from this cylinder? (Hint: find the number of moles of argon in each container.) Answer 4.07 × 10 3 Using the Ideal Gas Law to Calculate Gas Densities and Molar Masses The ideal gas law can also be used to calculate molar masses of gases from experimentally measured gas densities. To see how this is possible, we first rearrange the ideal gas law to obtain \\[\\dfrac{n}{V}=\\dfrac{P}{RT}\\label{10.4.9} \\] The left side has the units of moles per unit volume (mol/L). The number of moles of a substance equals its mass (\\(m\\), in grams) divided by its molar mass (\\(M\\), in grams per mole): \\[n=\\dfrac{m}{M}\\label{10.4.10} \\] Substituting this expression for \\(n\\) into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.9}\\) gives \\[\\dfrac{m}{MV}=\\dfrac{P}{RT}\\label{10.4.11} \\] Because \\(m/V\\) is the density \\(d\\) of a substance, we can replace \\(m/V\\) by \\(d\\) and rearrange to give \\[\\rho=\\dfrac{m}{V}=\\dfrac{MP}{RT}\\label{10.4.12} \\] The distance between particles in gases is large compared to the size of the particles, so their densities are much lower than the densities of liquids and solids. Consequently, gas density is usually measured in grams per liter (g/L) rather than grams per milliliter (g/mL). Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) Calculate the density of butane at 25°C and a pressure of 750 mmHg. Given: compound, temperature, and pressure Asked for: density Strategy: Calculate the molar mass of butane and convert all quantities to appropriate units for the value of the gas constant. Substitute these values into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) to obtain the density. Solution: A The molar mass of butane (C 4 H 10 ) is \\[M=(4)(12.011) + (10)(1.0079) = 58.123 \\rm g/mol \\nonumber \\] Using 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol) for R means that we need to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvins ( T = 25 + 273 = 298 K) and the pressure from millimeters of mercury to atmospheres: \\[P=\\rm750\\;mmHg\\times\\dfrac{1\\;atm}{760\\;mmHg}=0.987\\;atm \\nonumber \\] B Substituting these values into Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) gives \\[\\rho=\\rm\\dfrac{58.123\\;g/mol\\times0.987\\;atm}{0.08206\\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{K\\cdot mol}\\times298\\;K}=2.35\\;g/L \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Density of Radon Radon (Rn) is a radioactive gas formed by the decay of naturally occurring uranium in rocks such as granite. It tends to collect in the basements of houses and poses a significant health risk if present in indoor air. Many states now require that houses be tested for radon before they are sold. Calculate the density of radon at 1.00 atm pressure and 20°C and compare it with the density of nitrogen gas, which constitutes 80% of the atmosphere, under the same conditions to see why radon is found in basements rather than in attics. Answer radon, 9.23 g/L; N 2 , 1.17 g/L A common use of Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) is to determine the molar mass of an unknown gas by measuring its density at a known temperature and pressure. This method is particularly useful in identifying a gas that has been produced in a reaction, and it is not difficult to carry out. A flask or glass bulb of known volume is carefully dried, evacuated, sealed, and weighed empty. It is then filled with a sample of a gas at a known temperature and pressure and reweighed. The difference in mass between the two readings is the mass of the gas. The volume of the flask is usually determined by weighing the flask when empty and when filled with a liquid of known density such as water. The use of density measurements to calculate molar masses is illustrated in Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\). Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) The reaction of a copper penny with nitric acid results in the formation of a red-brown gaseous compound containing nitrogen and oxygen. A sample of the gas at a pressure of 727 mmHg and a temperature of 18°C weighs 0.289 g in a flask with a volume of 157.0 mL. Calculate the molar mass of the gas and suggest a reasonable chemical formula for the compound. Given: pressure, temperature, mass, and volume Asked for: molar mass and chemical formula Strategy: Solve Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) for the molar mass of the gas and then calculate the density of the gas from the information given. Convert all known quantities to the appropriate units for the gas constant being used. Substitute the known values into your equation and solve for the molar mass. Propose a reasonable empirical formula using the atomic masses of nitrogen and oxygen and the calculated molar mass of the gas. Solution: A Solving Equation \\(\\ref{10.4.12}\\) for the molar mass gives \\[M=\\dfrac{mRT}{PV}=\\dfrac{dRT}{P} \\nonumber \\] Density is the mass of the gas divided by its volume: \\[\\rho=\\dfrac{m}{V}=\\dfrac{0.289\\rm g}{0.157\\rm L}=1.84 \\rm g/L\\nonumber \\] B We must convert the other quantities to the appropriate units before inserting them into the equation: \\[T=18+273=291 K\\nonumber \\] \\[P=727 \\, mmHg \\times \\dfrac{1\\rm atm} {760\\rm mmHg} =0.957\\rm atm \\nonumber \\] The molar mass of the unknown gas is thus \\[M=\\rm\\dfrac{1.84\\;g/L\\times0.08206\\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{K\\cdot mol}\\times291\\;K}{0.957\\;atm}=45.9 g/mol\\nonumber \\] C The atomic masses of N and O are approximately 14 and 16, respectively, so we can construct a list showing the masses of possible combinations: \\[M({\\rm NO})=14 + 16=30 \\rm\\; g/mol\\nonumber \\] \\[M({\\rm N_2O})=(2)(14)+16=44 \\rm\\;g/mol\\nonumber \\] \\[M({\\rm NO_2})=14+(2)(16)=46 \\rm\\;g/mol\\nonumber \\] The most likely choice is NO 2 which is in agreement with the data. The red-brown color of smog also results from the presence of NO 2 gas. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) You are in charge of interpreting the data from an unmanned space probe that has just landed on Venus and sent back a report on its atmosphere. The data are as follows: pressure, 90 atm; temperature, 557°C; density, 58 g/L. The major constituent of the atmosphere (>95%) is carbon. Calculate the molar mass of the major gas present and identify it. Answer 44 g/mol; \\(CO_2\\) Summary The ideal gas law is derived from empirical relationships among the pressure, the volume, the temperature, and the number of moles of a gas; it can be used to calculate any of the four properties if the other three are known. Ideal gas equation : \\(PV = nRT\\), where \\(R = 0.08206 \\dfrac{\\rm L\\cdot atm}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}=8.3145 \\dfrac{\\rm J}{\\rm K\\cdot mol}\\) General gas equation : \\(\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{n_iT_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{n_fT_f}\\) Density of a gas: \\(\\rho=\\dfrac{MP}{RT}\\) The empirical relationships among the volume, the temperature, the pressure, and the amount of a gas can be combined into the ideal gas law , PV = nRT . The proportionality constant, R , is called the gas constant and has the value 0.08206 (L•atm)/(K•mol), 8.3145 J/(K•mol), or 1.9872 cal/(K•mol), depending on the units used. The ideal gas law describes the behavior of an ideal gas , a hypothetical substance whose behavior can be explained quantitatively by the ideal gas law and the kinetic molecular theory of gases. Standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 0°C and 1 atm. The volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas at STP is 22.41 L, the standard molar volume . All of the empirical gas relationships are special cases of the ideal gas law in which two of the four parameters are held constant. The ideal gas law allows us to calculate the value of the fourth quantity ( P , V , T , or n ) needed to describe a gaseous sample when the others are known and also predict the value of these quantities following a change in conditions if the original conditions (values of P , V , T , and n ) are known. The ideal gas law can also be used to calculate the density of a gas if its molar mass is known or, conversely, the molar mass of an unknown gas sample if its density is measured."

         "Learning Objective accurately and precisely use reaction mechanism notation and symbols including curved arrows to show the flow of electrons The Arrow Notation in Mechanisms Since chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds, a consideration of the movement of bonding (and non-bonding) valence shell electrons is essential to this understanding.

If a covalent single bond is broken so that one electron of the shared pair remains with each fragment, as in the first example, this bond-breaking is called homolysis .

Such species are referred to as reactive intermediates , and are believed to be transient intermediates in many reactions. The general structures and names of four such intermediates are given below. A pair of widely used terms, related to the Lewis acid-base notation, should also be introduced here. Electrophile: An electron deficient atom, ion or molecule that has an affinity for an electron pair, and will bond to a base or nucleophile. Nucleophile: An atom, ion or molecule that has an electron pair that may be donated in bonding to an electrophile (or Lewis acid). Using these definitions, it is clear that carbocations ( called carbonium ions in the older literature ) are electrophiles and carbanions are nucleophiles. Carbenes have only a valence shell sextet of electrons and are therefore electron deficient. In this sense they are electrophiles, but the non-bonding electron pair also gives carbenes nucleophilic character. As a rule, the electrophilic character dominates carbene reactivity. Carbon radicals have only seven valence electrons, and may be considered electron deficient; however, they do not in general bond to nucleophilic electron pairs, so their chemistry exhibits unique differences from that of conventional electrophiles. Radical intermediates are often called free radicals . The importance of electrophile / nucleophile terminology comes from the fact that many organic reactions involve at some stage the bonding of a nucleophile to an electrophile, a process that generally leads to a stable intermediate or product. Reactions of this kind are sometimes called ionic reactions , since ionic reactants or products are often involved. Some common examples of ionic reactions and their mechanisms may be examined below. The shapes ideally assumed by these intermediates becomes important when considering the stereochemistry of reactions in which they play a role. A simple tetravalent compound like methane, CH 4 , has a tetrahedral configuration. Carbocations have only three bonds to the charge bearing carbon, so it adopts a planar trigonal configuration. Carbanions are pyramidal in shape ( tetrahedral if the electron pair is viewed as a substituent), but these species invert rapidly at room temperature, passing through a higher energy planar form in which the electron pair occupies a p-orbital. Radicals are intermediate in configuration, the energy difference between pyramidal and planar forms being very small. Since three points determine a plane, the shape of carbenes must be planar; however, the valence electron distribution varies. Ionic Reactions The principles and terms introduced in the previous sections can now be summarized and illustrated by the following three examples. Reactions such as these are called ionic or polar reactions, because they often involve charged species and the bonding together of electrophiles and nucleophiles . Ionic reactions normally take place in liquid solutions, where solvent molecules assist the formation of charged intermediates. 0 1 NaN The substitution reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in three steps. The first is an acid-base equilibrium, in which HCl protonates the oxygen atom of the alcohol. The resulting conjugate acid then loses water in a second step to give a carbocation intermediate. Finally, this electrophile combines with the chloride anion nucleophile to give the final product. NaN The addition reaction shown on the left can be viewed as taking place in two steps. The first step can again be considered an acid-base equilibrium, with the pi-electrons of the carbon-carbon double bond functioning as a base. The resulting conjugate acid is a carbocation, and this electrophile combines with the nucleophilic bromide anion. NaN The elimination reaction shown on the left takes place in one step. The bond breaking and making operations that take place in this step are described by the curved arrows. The initial stage may also be viewed as an acid-base interaction, with hydroxide ion serving as the base and a hydrogen atom component of the alkyl chloride as an acid. NaN There are many kinds of molecular rearrangements called isomerizations. The examples shown on the left are from an important class called tautomerization or, more specifically, keto-enol tautomerization. Tautomers are rapidly interconverted constitutional isomers, usually distinguished by a different bonding location for a labile hydrogen atom (colored red here) and a differently located double bond. The equilibrium between tautomers is not only rapid under normal conditions, but it often strongly favors one of the isomers (acetone, for example, is 99.999% keto tautomer).

Describe Rutherford's gold foil experiment and explain how this experiment altered the \"plum pudding\" model. Draw a diagram of the Rutherford model of the atom and label the nucleus and the electron cloud. Dalton's Atomic Theory held up well to a lot of the different chemical experiments that scientists performed to test it. In fact, for almost 100 years, it seemed as if Dalton's Atomic Theory was the whole truth. However, in 1897, a scientist named J. J. Thomson conducted some research that suggested that Dalton's Atomic Theory was not the entire story. He suggested that the small, negatively charged particles making up the cathode ray were actually pieces of atoms. He called these pieces \"corpuscles,\" although today we know them as electrons . Thanks to his clever experiments and careful reasoning, J. J. Thomson is credited with the discovery of the electron. Electrons and Plums The electron was discovered by J. J. Thomson in 1897. The existence of protons was also known, as was the fact that atoms were neutral in charge. Since the intact atom had no net charge and the electron and proton had opposite charges, the next step after the discovery of subatomic particles was to figure out how these particles were arranged in the atom. This was a difficult task because of the incredibly small size of the atom. Therefore, scientists set out to design a model of what they believed the atom could look like. The goal of each atomic model was to accurately represent all of the experimental evidence about atoms in the simplest way possible. Following the discovery of the electron, J.J. Thomson developed what became known as the \" plum pudding \" model in 1904. Plum pudding is an English dessert similar to a blueberry muffin. In Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom, the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge like blueberries stuck into a muffin. The positive matter was thought to be jelly-like or similar to a thick soup. The electrons were somewhat mobile. As they got closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative charges, and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom. However, this model of the atom soon gave way to a new model developed by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) about five years later. Thomson did still receive many honors during his lifetime, including being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and a knighthood in 1908. Atoms and Gold In 1911, Rutherford and coworkers Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden initiated a series of groundbreaking experiments that would completely change the accepted model of the atom. They bombarded very thin sheets of gold foil with fast moving alpha particles . Alpha particles, a type of natural radioactive particle, are positively charged particles with a mass about four times that of a hydrogen atom. According to the accepted atomic model, in which an atom's mass and charge are uniformly distributed throughout the atom, the scientists expected that all of the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with only a slight deflection or none at all. Surprisingly, while most of the alpha particles were indeed not deflected, a very small percentage (about 1 in 8000 particles) bounced off the gold foil at very large angles. Some were even redirected back toward the source. No prior knowledge had prepared them for this discovery. In a famous quote, Rutherford exclaimed that it was \"as if you had fired a 15-inch [artillery] shell at a piece of tissue and it came back and hit you.\" Rutherford needed to come up with an entirely new model of the atom in order to explain his results. Because the vast majority of the alpha particles had passed through the gold, he reasoned that most of the atom was empty space. In contrast, the particles that were highly deflected must have experienced a tremendously powerful force within the atom. He concluded that all of the positive charge and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in a very small space in the atom's interior, which he called the nucleus. The nucleus is the tiny, dense, central core of the atom and is composed of protons and neutrons. Rutherford's atomic model became known as the nuclear model . In the nuclear atom, the protons and neutrons, which comprise nearly all of the mass of the atom, are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom. The electrons are distributed around the nucleus and occupy most of the volume of the atom. It is worth emphasizing just how small the nucleus is compared to the rest of the atom. If we could blow up an atom to be the size of a large professional football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a marble. Rutherford's model proved to be an important step towards a full understanding of the atom. However, it did not completely address the nature of the electrons and the way in which they occupy the vast space around the nucleus. It was not until some years later that a full understanding of the electron was achieved. This proved to be the key to understanding the chemical properties of elements. Atomic Nucleus The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The figure below shows these parts of the atom. The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! Holding it all Together Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another. So why doesn't the nucleus fly apart? An even stronger force—called the strong nuclear force —holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. Summary Atoms are the ultimate building blocks of all matter. The modern atomic theory establishes the concepts of atoms and how they compose matter. Bombardment of gold foil with alpha particles showed that some particles were deflected.

         "Learning Objectives To understand how different phases affect equilibria. When the products and reactants of an equilibrium reaction form a single phase, whether gas or liquid, the system is a homogeneous equilibrium. In such situations, the concentrations of the reactants and products can vary over a wide range. In contrast, a system whose reactants, products, or both are in more than one phase is a heterogeneous equilibrium, such as the reaction of a gas with a solid or liquid. As noted in the previous section, the equilibrium constant expression is actually a ratio of activities. To simplify the calculations in general chemistry courses, the activity of each substance in the reaction is often approximated using a ratio of the molarity of a substance compared to the standard state of that substance. For substances that are liquids or solids, the standard state is just the concentration of the substance within the liquid or solid. Because the molar concentrations of pure liquids and solids normally do not vary greatly with temperature, the ratio of the molarity to the standard state for substances that are liquids or solids always has a value of 1. For example, for a compound such as CaF 2 (s), the term going into the equilibrium expression is [CaF 2 ]/[CaF 2 ] which cancels to unity. Thus, when the activities of the solids and liquids (including solvents) are incorporated into the equilibrium expression, they do not change the value. Consider the following reaction, which is used in the final firing of some types of pottery to produce brilliant metallic glazes: \\[\\ce{CO2(g) + C(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2CO(g)} \\label{Eq14.4.1} \\] The glaze is created when metal oxides are reduced to metals by the product, carbon monoxide. The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is as follows: \\[K=\\dfrac{a_{\\ce{CO}}^2}{a_{\\ce{CO2}}a_{C}}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO2}][1]}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO_2}]}\\label{Eq14.4.2} \\] The equilibrium constant for this reaction can also be written in terms of the partial pressures of the gases: \\[K_p=\\dfrac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}} \\label{Eq14.4.3} \\] Incorporating all the constant values into \\(K′\\) or \\(K_p\\) allows us to focus on the substances whose concentrations change during the reaction. Although the activities of pure liquids or solids are not written explicitly in the equilibrium constant expression, these substances must be present in the reaction mixture for chemical equilibrium to occur. Whatever the concentrations of \\(\\ce{CO}\\) and \\(\\ce{CO_2}\\), the system described in Equation \\(\\ref{Eq14.4.1}\\) will reach chemical equilibrium only if a stoichiometric amount of solid carbon or excess solid carbon has been added so that some is still present once the system has reached equilibrium. As shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), it does not matter whether 1 g or 100 g of solid carbon is present; in either case, the composition of the gaseous components of the system will be the same at equilibrium. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write each expression for \\(K\\), incorporating all constants, and \\(K_p\\) for the following equilibrium reactions. \\(\\ce{PCl3(l) + Cl2(g) <=> PCl5(s)}\\) \\(\\ce{Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) <=> 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)}\\) Given : balanced equilibrium equations. Asked for : expressions for \\(K\\) and \\(K_p\\). Strategy : Find \\(K\\) by writing each equilibrium constant expression as the ratio of the concentrations of the products and reactants, each raised to its coefficient in the chemical equation. Then express \\(K_p\\) as the ratio of the partial pressures of the products and reactants, each also raised to its coefficient in the chemical equation. Solution This reaction contains a pure solid (\\(PCl_5\\)) and a pure liquid (\\(PCl_3\\)). Their activities are equal to 1, so when incorporated into the equilibrium constant expression, they do not change the value. So \\[K=\\dfrac{1}{(1)[Cl_2]} \\nonumber \\] and \\[K_p=\\dfrac{1}{(1)P_{Cl_2}} \\nonumber \\] This reaction contains two pure solids (\\(Fe_3O_4\\) and \\(Fe\\)), which are each assigned a value of 1 in the equilibrium constant expressions: \\[K=\\dfrac{(1)[H_2O]^4}{(1)[H_2]^4} \\nonumber \\] and \\[K_p=\\dfrac{(1)(P_{H_2O})^4}{(1)(P_{H_2})^4} \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the expressions for \\(K\\) and \\(K_p\\) for the following reactions. \\(\\ce{CaCO3(s) <=> CaO(s) + CO2(g)}\\) \\( \\underset{glucose}{\\ce{C6H12O6(s)}} + \\ce{6O2(g) <=> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(g)}\\) Answer a \\(K = [\\ce{CO_2}]\\) and \\(K_p = P_{\\ce{CO_2}}\\) Answer b \\(K=\\dfrac{[CO_2]^6[H_2O]^6}{[O_2]^6}\\) and \\(K_p=\\dfrac{(P_{CO_2})^6(P_{H_2O})^6}{(P_{O_2})^6}\\) For reactions carried out in solution, the solvent is assumed to be pure, and therefore is assigned an activity equal to 1 in the equilibrium constant expression. The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities. The result is that the equilibrium constant expressions appear to only depend upon the concentrations of the solutes. The activities of pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are defined as having a value of '1'. Often, it is said that these activities are \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. This is an unfortunate use of words. The activities are not \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. Rather, because they have a value of '1', they do not change the value of the equilibrium constant when they are multiplied together with the other terms. The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities. Summary An equilibrated system that contains products and reactants in a single phase is a homogeneous equilibrium; a system whose reactants, products, or both are in more than one phase is a heterogeneous equilibrium.",

Because the molar concentrations of pure liquids and solids normally do not vary greatly with temperature, the ratio of the molarity to the standard state for substances that are liquids or solids always has a value of 1. For example, for a compound such as CaF 2 (s), the term going into the equilibrium expression is [CaF 2 ]/[CaF 2 ] which cancels to unity. Thus, when the activities of the solids and liquids (including solvents) are incorporated into the equilibrium expression, they do not change the value. Consider the following reaction, which is used in the final firing of some types of pottery to produce brilliant metallic glazes: \\[\\ce{CO2(g) + C(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2CO(g)} \\label{Eq14.4.1} \\] The glaze is created when metal oxides are reduced to metals by the product, carbon monoxide. The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is as follows: \\[K=\\dfrac{a_{\\ce{CO}}^2}{a_{\\ce{CO2}}a_{C}}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO2}][1]}=\\dfrac{[\\ce{CO}]^2}{[\\ce{CO_2}]}\\label{Eq14.4.2} \\] The equilibrium constant for this reaction can also be written in terms of the partial pressures of the gases: \\[K_p=\\dfrac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}} \\label{Eq14.4.3} \\] Incorporating all the constant values into \\(K′\\) or \\(K_p\\) allows us to focus on the substances whose concentrations change during the reaction. Although the activities of pure liquids or solids are not written explicitly in the equilibrium constant expression, these substances must be present in the reaction mixture for chemical equilibrium to occur. Whatever the concentrations of \\(\\ce{CO}\\) and \\(\\ce{CO_2}\\), the system described in Equation \\(\\ref{Eq14.4.1}\\) will reach chemical equilibrium only if a stoichiometric amount of solid carbon or excess solid carbon has been added so that some is still present once the system has reached equilibrium. As shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), it does not matter whether 1 g or 100 g of solid carbon is present; in either case, the composition of the gaseous components of the system will be the same at equilibrium. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write each expression for \\(K\\), incorporating all constants, and \\(K_p\\) for the following equilibrium reactions. \\(\\ce{PCl3(l) + Cl2(g) <=> PCl5(s)}\\) \\(\\ce{Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) <=> 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)}\\) Given : balanced equilibrium equations. Asked for : expressions for \\(K\\) and \\(K_p\\). Strategy : Find \\(K\\) by writing each equilibrium constant expression as the ratio of the concentrations of the products and reactants, each raised to its coefficient in the chemical equation. Then express \\(K_p\\) as the ratio of the partial pressures of the products and reactants, each also raised to its coefficient in the chemical equation. Solution This reaction contains a pure solid (\\(PCl_5\\)) and a pure liquid (\\(PCl_3\\)). Their activities are equal to 1, so when incorporated into the equilibrium constant expression, they do not change the value. So \\[K=\\dfrac{1}{(1)[Cl_2]} \\nonumber \\] and \\[K_p=\\dfrac{1}{(1)P_{Cl_2}} \\nonumber \\] This reaction contains two pure solids (\\(Fe_3O_4\\) and \\(Fe\\)), which are each assigned a value of 1 in the equilibrium constant expressions: \\[K=\\dfrac{(1)[H_2O]^4}{(1)[H_2]^4} \\nonumber \\] and \\[K_p=\\dfrac{(1)(P_{H_2O})^4}{(1)(P_{H_2})^4} \\nonumber \\] Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Write the expressions for \\(K\\) and \\(K_p\\) for the following reactions. \\(\\ce{CaCO3(s) <=> CaO(s) + CO2(g)}\\) \\( \\underset{glucose}{\\ce{C6H12O6(s)}} + \\ce{6O2(g) <=> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(g)}\\) Answer a \\(K = [\\ce{CO_2}]\\) and \\(K_p = P_{\\ce{CO_2}}\\) Answer b \\(K=\\dfrac{[CO_2]^6[H_2O]^6}{[O_2]^6}\\) and \\(K_p=\\dfrac{(P_{CO_2})^6(P_{H_2O})^6}{(P_{O_2})^6}\\) For reactions carried out in solution, the solvent is assumed to be pure, and therefore is assigned an activity equal to 1 in the equilibrium constant expression. The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities. The result is that the equilibrium constant expressions appear to only depend upon the concentrations of the solutes. The activities of pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are defined as having a value of '1'. Often, it is said that these activities are \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. This is an unfortunate use of words. The activities are not \"left out\" of equilibrium constant expressions. Rather, because they have a value of '1', they do not change the value of the equilibrium constant when they are multiplied together with the other terms. The activities of the solutes are approximated by their molarities. Summary An equilibrated system that contains products and reactants in a single phase is a homogeneous equilibrium; a system whose reactants, products, or both are in more than one phase is a heterogeneous equilibrium."

A 500-mL bottle of water at room temperature and a 2-L bottle of water at the same temperature were placed in a refrigerator. After 30 minutes, the 500-mL bottle of water had cooled to the temperature of the refrigerator. An hour later, the 2-L of water had cooled to the same temperature. When asked which sample of water lost the most heat, one student replied that both bottles lost the same amount of heat because they started at the same temperature and finished at the same temperature. A second student thought that the 2-L bottle of water lost more heat because there was more water. A third student believed that the 500-mL bottle of water lost more heat because it cooled more quickly.

         "Learning Objectives Give two major types of reactions of alcohols. Describe the result of the oxidation of a primary alcohol. Describe the result of the oxidation of a secondary alcohol. Chemical reactions in alcohols occur mainly at the functional group, but some involve hydrogen atoms attached to the OH -bearing carbon atom or to an adjacent carbon atom. Of the three major kinds of alcohol reactions, which are summarized in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), two—dehydration and oxidation—are considered here. The third reaction type— esterification —is covered elsewhere. Dehydration As noted in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), an alcohol undergoes dehydration in the presence of a catalyst to form an alkene and water. The reaction removes the OH group from the alcohol carbon atom and a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon atom in the same molecule: Under the proper conditions, it is possible for the dehydration to occur between two alcohol molecules. The entire OH group of one molecule and only the hydrogen atom of the OH group of the second molecule are removed. The two ethyl groups attached to an oxygen atom form an ether molecule. ( Ethers are discussed in elsewhere ) Thus, depending on conditions, one can prepare either alkenes or ethers by the dehydration of alcohols. Both dehydration and hydration reactions occur continuously in cellular metabolism, with enzymes serving as catalysts and at a temperature of about 37°C. The following reaction occurs in the \"Embden–Meyerhof\" pathway Although the participating compounds are complex, the reaction is the same: elimination of water from the starting material. The idea is that if you know the chemistry of a particular functional group, you know the chemistry of hundreds of different compounds. Oxidation Primary and secondary alcohols are readily oxidized. We saw earlier how methanol and ethanol are oxidized by liver enzymes to form aldehydes. Because a variety of oxidizing agents can bring about oxidation, we can indicate an oxidizing agent without specifying a particular one by writing an equation with the symbol [O] above the arrow. For example, we write the oxidation of ethanol—a primary alcohol—to form acetaldehyde—an aldehyde—as follows: We shall see that aldehydes are even more easily oxidized than alcohols and yield carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones . The oxidation of isopropyl alcohol by potassium dichromate (\\(\\ce{K2Cr2O7}\\)) gives acetone, the simplest ketone: Unlike aldehydes, ketones are relatively resistant to further oxidation, so no special precautions are required to isolate them as they form. Note that in oxidation of both primary (RCH 2 OH) and secondary (R 2 CHOH) alcohols, two hydrogen atoms are removed from the alcohol molecule, one from the OH group and other from the carbon atom that bears the OH group. These reactions can also be carried out in the laboratory with chemical oxidizing agents. One such oxidizing agent is potassium dichromate. The balanced equation (showing only the species involved in the reaction) in this case is as follows: \\[\\ce{8H^{=} + Cr2O7^{2-} + 3CH3CH2OH -> 3CH3CHO + 2Cr^{3+} + 7H2O} \\nonumber \\] Alcohol oxidation is important in living organisms. Enzyme-controlled oxidation reactions provide the energy cells need to do useful work. One step in the metabolism of carbohydrates involves the oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in isocitric acid to a ketone group: The overall type of reaction is the same as that in the conversion of isopropyl alcohol to acetone. Tertiary alcohols (R 3 COH) are resistant to oxidation because the carbon atom that carries the OH group does not have a hydrogen atom attached but is instead bonded to other carbon atoms. The oxidation reactions we have described involve the formation of a carbon-to-oxygen double bond. Thus, the carbon atom bearing the OH group must be able to release one of its attached atoms to form the double bond. The carbon-to-hydrogen bonding is easily broken under oxidative conditions, but carbon-to-carbon bonds are not. Therefore tertiary alcohols are not easily oxidized.

CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 OH Solution The first step is to recognize the class of each alcohol as primary, secondary, or tertiary. This alcohol has the OH group on a carbon atom that is attached to only one other carbon atom, so it is a primary alcohol. Oxidation forms first an aldehyde and further oxidation forms a carboxylic acid. This alcohol has the OH group on a carbon atom that is attached to three other carbon atoms, so it is a tertiary alcohol. No reaction occurs.

         "Learning Objectives Give two major types of reactions of alcohols. Describe the result of the oxidation of a primary alcohol. Describe the result of the oxidation of a secondary alcohol. Chemical reactions in alcohols occur mainly at the functional group, but some involve hydrogen atoms attached to the OH -bearing carbon atom or to an adjacent carbon atom. Of the three major kinds of alcohol reactions, which are summarized in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), two—dehydration and oxidation—are considered here. The third reaction type— esterification —is covered elsewhere. Dehydration As noted in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), an alcohol undergoes dehydration in the presence of a catalyst to form an alkene and water. The reaction removes the OH group from the alcohol carbon atom and a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon atom in the same molecule: Under the proper conditions, it is possible for the dehydration to occur between two alcohol molecules. The entire OH group of one molecule and only the hydrogen atom of the OH group of the second molecule are removed. The two ethyl groups attached to an oxygen atom form an ether molecule. ( Ethers are discussed in elsewhere ) Thus, depending on conditions, one can prepare either alkenes or ethers by the dehydration of alcohols. Both dehydration and hydration reactions occur continuously in cellular metabolism, with enzymes serving as catalysts and at a temperature of about 37°C. The following reaction occurs in the \"Embden–Meyerhof\" pathway Although the participating compounds are complex, the reaction is the same: elimination of water from the starting material. The idea is that if you know the chemistry of a particular functional group, you know the chemistry of hundreds of different compounds. Oxidation Primary and secondary alcohols are readily oxidized. We saw earlier how methanol and ethanol are oxidized by liver enzymes to form aldehydes. Because a variety of oxidizing agents can bring about oxidation, we can indicate an oxidizing agent without specifying a particular one by writing an equation with the symbol [O] above the arrow. For example, we write the oxidation of ethanol—a primary alcohol—to form acetaldehyde—an aldehyde—as follows: We shall see that aldehydes are even more easily oxidized than alcohols and yield carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones . The oxidation of isopropyl alcohol by potassium dichromate (\\(\\ce{K2Cr2O7}\\)) gives acetone, the simplest ketone: Unlike aldehydes, ketones are relatively resistant to further oxidation, so no special precautions are required to isolate them as they form. Note that in oxidation of both primary (RCH 2 OH) and secondary (R 2 CHOH) alcohols, two hydrogen atoms are removed from the alcohol molecule, one from the OH group and other from the carbon atom that bears the OH group. These reactions can also be carried out in the laboratory with chemical oxidizing agents. One such oxidizing agent is potassium dichromate.

         "As we begin our study of nucleophilic substitution reactions, we will focus at first on simple alkyl halide compounds. While the specific reactions we'll initially consider do not occur in living things, it is nonetheless useful to start with alkyl halides as a model to illustrate some fundamental ideas that we must cover. Later, we will move on to apply what we have earned about alkyl halides to the larger and more complex biomolecules that are undergoing nucleophilic substitution right now in your own cells. The \\(S_N2\\) mechanism You may recall from our brief introduction to the topic in chapter 6 that there are two mechanistic models for how a nucleophilic substitution reaction can proceed. In one mechanism, the reaction is concerted: it takes place in a single step, and bond-forming and bond-breaking occur simultaneously. This is illustrated by the reaction between chloromethane and hydroxide ion: Recall that the hydroxide ion in this reaction is acting as a nucleophile (an electron-rich, nucleus-loving species), the carbon atom of chloromethane is acting as an electrophile (an electron-poor species which is attracted to electrons), and the chloride ion is the leaving group (where the name is self-evident). Organic chemists refer to this mechanism by the term '\\(S_N2\\)', where S stands for 'substitution', the subscript N stands for 'nucleophilic', and the number 2 refers to the fact that this is a bimolecular reaction: the overall rate depends on a step in which two separate species collide. A potential energy diagram for this reaction shows the transition state (TS) as the highest point on the pathway from reactants to products. The geometry of an \\(S_N2\\) reaction is specific: the reaction can only occur when the nucleophile collides with the electrophilic carbon from the opposite side relative to the leaving group. This is referred to as backside attack. Approach from the front side simply doesn't work: the leaving group - which, like the nucleophile is an electron-rich group - blocks the way. 2 The result of backside attack is that the bonding geometry at the electrophilic carbon inverts (turns inside-out) as the reaction proceeds. 3 The transition state of the reaction is illustrated by drawing dotted lines to represent the covalent bonds that are in the process of breaking or forming. Because the formal charge on the oxygen nucleophile changes from negative one to zero as the reaction proceeds, and conversely the charge on the chlorine leaving group changes from zero to negative one, at the transition state both atoms are shown bearing a partial negative charge (the symbol \\(\\delta \\)-). One other drawing convention for transition states is to use brackets, with the double-dagger symbol in subscript. Notice that the transition state for an \\(S_N2\\) reaction has trigonal bipyramidal geometry: the nucleophile, electrophile, and leaving group form a straight line, and the three substituents on carbon (all hydrogen atoms in this case) are arranged in the same plane at \\(120^{\\circ}\\) angles. What is the measure in degrees) of the \\(H-C-O\\) angle in the \\(S_N2\\) transition state illustrated above? Consider what would happen if we were to replace one of the hydrogen atoms in chloromethane with deuterium (the \\(^2H\\) isotope), and one with tritium (the radioactive \\(^3H\\) isotope). Now, because it has four different substituents, our carbon electrophile is a chiral center. We'll arbitrarily assume that we start with the \\(S\\) enantiomer. As the hydroxide nucleophile attacks from the backside and the bonding geometry at carbon inverts, we see that the stereochemistry of the product reflects this inversion: we end up with the \\(R\\) enantiomer of the chiral product. \\(S_N2\\) reactions proceed with inversion of stereochemical configuration at the electrophilic carbon. video tutorial/animation: inversion of configuration during SN2 reactions The \\(S_N1\\) mechanism A second model for the nucleophilic substitution reaction is called the \\(S_N1\\) mechanism. The '1' in \\(S_N1\\) indicates that the rate-determining step of the reaction is unimolecular: in other words, the rate-determining step involves a single molecule breaking apart (rather than two molecules colliding as was the case in the \\(S_N2\\) mechanism.) In an \\(S_N1\\) mechanism the carbon-leaving group bond breaks first, before the nucleophile approaches, resulting in formation of a carbocation intermediate (step 1): A carbocation is a powerful electrophile: because the carbon lacks a complete octet of valence electrons, it is 'electron-hungry'. In step 2, a lone pair of electrons on the water nucleophile fills the empty p orbital of the carbocation to form a new bond. Notice that this is actually a three-step mechanism, with a final, rapid acid-base step leading to the alcohol product. A potential energy diagram for this \\(S_N1\\) reaction shows that each of the two positively-charged intermediate stages (\\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) in the diagram) can be visualized as a valley in the path of the reaction, higher in energy than both the reactant and product but lower in energy than the transition states. The first, bond-breaking step is the slowest, rate-determining step - notice it has the highest activation energy and leads to the highest-energy species (\\(I_1\\), the carbocation intermediate). Step 2 is rapid: a new covalent bond forms between a carbocation and and a water nucleophile , and no covalent bonds are broken. Recall from chapter 7 that Bronsted-Lowry proton transfer steps like step 3 are rapid, with low activation energies. The nucleophilic substitution reactions we have seen so far are examples of hydrolysis. This term is one that you will encounter frequently in organic and biological chemistry. Hydrolysis means 'breaking with water': in a hydrolysis reaction, a water molecule (or hydroxide ion) participates in the breaking of a covalent bond. There are many reaction types other than nucleophilic substitution that can accurately be described as hydrolysis, and we will see several examples throughout the remaining chapters of this book. Solvolysis is a more general term, used when a bond in a reagent is broken by a solvent molecule: usually, the solvent in question is water or an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. Draw a mechanism for the \\( S_N1\\) solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride in methanol. What new functional group has been formed? We saw that \\(S_N2\\) reactions result in inversion of stereochemical configuration at the carbon center. What about the stereochemical outcome of \\(S_N1\\) reactions? Recall that a carbocation is \\(sp^2\\)-hybridized, with an empty p orbital perpendicular to the plane formed by the three sigma bonds: In the second step of an \\(S_N1\\) reaction, the nucleophile can attack from either side of the carbocation (the leaving group is already gone, and thus cannot block attack from one side like in an \\(S_N2\\) reaction). Consider an \\(S_N1\\) reaction with a chiral tertiary alkyl chloride: Because the nucleophile is free to attack from either side of the carbocation electrophile, the reaction leads to a 50:50 mixture of two stereoisomeric products. In other words: In general nonenzymatic SN1 reaction can occur with either retention or inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon, leading to racemization if the carbon is chiral. For an example, consider the hydrolysis of (S)-3-chloro-3-methylhexane. The result of this (nonenzymatic) reaction is a racemic mixture of chiral alcohols. It is important to remember, however, that enzymatic reactions are in almost all cases very specific with regard to stereochemical outcome. A biochemical \\(S_N1\\) reaction, as we shall see later, can result in either inversion or retention of configuration at the electrophilic carbon, but generally not a mixture of both: the two reactants are bound with specific geometry in the enzyme's active site, so that the nucleophile can approach from one side only. (The following exercises refer to nonbiological reactions) Draw a complete mechanism for the hydrolysis reaction in the previous figure, showing all bond-breaking and bond-forming steps, and all intermediate species. Draw structures representing TS1 and TS2 in the reaction. Use the solid/dash wedge convention to show three dimensions. What is the expected optical rotation of the product mixture? Could the two organic products be separated on a silica column chromatography? Draw the product(s) of the hydrolysis of (R)-3-chloro-3-methyl heptane. What can you predict, if anything, about the optical rotation of the product(s)? Draw the product(s) of the hydrolysis of (3R,5R)-3-chloro-3,5-dimethyl heptane. What can you predict, if anything, about the optical rotation of the product(s)? Before we go on to look at some actual biochemical nucleophilic substitution reactions, we first need to lay the intellectual groundwork by focusing more closely on the characteristics of the three principal partners in the nucleophilic substitution reaction: the nucleophile, the electrophile, and the leaving group. In addition, we need to consider the carbocation intermediate that plays such a key role in the \\(S_N1\\) mechanism. For the sake of simplicity, we will continue to use simple, non-biological organic molecules and reaction examples as we work through the basic concepts.

         "Learning Objectives To assign a Lewis dot symbol to elements not having an octet of electrons in their compounds. Three cases can be constructed that do not follow the octet rule, and as such, they are known as the exceptions to the octet rule. Following the Octet Rule for Lewis Dot Structures leads to the most accurate depictions of stable molecular and atomic structures and because of this we always want to use the octet rule when drawing Lewis Dot Structures. However, it is hard to imagine that one rule could be followed by all molecules. There is always an exception, and in this case, three exceptions: When there are an odd number of valence electrons When there are too few valence electrons When there are too many valence electrons Exception 1: Species with Odd Numbers of Electrons The first exception to the Octet Rule is when there are an odd number of valence electrons. An example of this would be Nitrogen (II) Oxide also called nitric oxide (\\(\\ce{NO}\\). Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons while Oxygen has 6. The total would be 11 valence electrons to be used. The Octet Rule for this molecule is fulfilled in the above example, however that is with 10 valence electrons. The last one does not know where to go. The lone electron is called an unpaired electron. But where should the unpaired electron go? The unpaired electron is usually placed in the Lewis Dot Structure so that each element in the structure will have the lowest formal charge possible. The formal charge is the perceived charge on an individual atom in a molecule when atoms do not contribute equal numbers of electrons to the bonds they participate in . No formal charge at all is the most ideal situation. An example of a stable molecule with an odd number of valence electrons would be nitric oxide. nitric oxide has 11 valence electrons. If you need more information about formal charges, see Lewis Structures. If we were to imagine nitric oxide had ten valence electrons we would come up with the Lewis Structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)): Let's look at the formal charges of Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) based on this Lewis structure. Nitrogen normally has five valence electrons. In Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), it has two lone pair electrons and it participates in two bonds (a double bond) with oxygen. This results in nitrogen having a formal charge of +1. Oxygen normally has six valence electrons. In Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), oxygen has four lone pair electrons and it participates in two bonds with nitrogen. Oxygen therefore has a formal charge of 0. The overall molecule here has a formal charge of +1 (+1 for nitrogen, 0 for oxygen. +1 + 0 = +1). However, if we add the eleventh electron to nitrogen (because we want the molecule to have the lowest total formal charge), it will bring both the nitrogen and the molecule's overall charges to zero, the most ideal formal charge situation. That is exactly what is done to get the correct Lewis structure for nitric oxide (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)): Free Radicals There are actually very few stable molecules with odd numbers of electrons that exist, since that unpaired electron is willing to react with other unpaired electrons. Most odd electron species are highly reactive, which we call Free Radicals. Because of their instability, free radicals bond to atoms in which they can take an electron from in order to become stable, making them very chemically reactive. Radicals are found as both reactants and products, but generally react to form more stable molecules as soon as they can. In order to emphasize the existence of the unpaired electron, radicals are denoted with a dot in front of their chemical symbol as with \\(\\cdot OH\\), the hydroxyl radical. An example of a radical you may by familiar with already is the gaseous chlorine atom, denoted \\(\\cdot Cl\\). Interestingly, an odd Number of Valence Electrons will result in the molecule being paramagnetic. Exception 2: Incomplete Octets The second exception to the Octet Rule is when there are too few valence electrons that results in an incomplete Octet. There are even more occasions where the octet rule does not give the most correct depiction of a molecule or ion. This is also the case with incomplete octets. Species with incomplete octets are pretty rare and generally are only found in some beryllium, aluminum, and boron compounds including the boron hydrides. Let's take a look at one such hydride, BH 3 (Borane). If one were to make a Lewis structure for BH 3 following the basic strategies for drawing Lewis structures, one would probably come up with this structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)): The problem with this structure is that boron has an incomplete octet; it only has six electrons around it. Hydrogen atoms can naturally only have only 2 electrons in their outermost shell (their version of an octet), and as such there are no spare electrons to form a double bond with boron. One might surmise that the failure of this structure to form complete octets must mean that this bond should be ionic instead of covalent. However, boron has an electronegativity that is very similar to hydrogen, meaning there is likely very little ionic character in the hydrogen to boron bonds, and as such this Lewis structure, though it does not fulfill the octet rule, is likely the best structure possible for depicting BH 3 with Lewis theory. One of the things that may account for BH 3 's incomplete octet is that it is commonly a transitory species, formed temporarily in reactions that involve multiple steps. Let's take a look at another incomplete octet situation dealing with boron, BF 3 (Boron trifluorine). Like with BH 3 , the initial drawing of a Lewis structure of BF 3 will form a structure where boron has only six electrons around it (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)). If you look Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\), you can see that the fluorine atoms possess extra lone pairs that they can use to make additional bonds with boron, and you might think that all you have to do is make one lone pair into a bond and the structure will be correct. If we add one double bond between boron and one of the fluorines we get the following Lewis Structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)): Each fluorine has eight electrons, and the boron atom has eight as well! Each atom has a perfect octet, right? Not so fast. We must examine the formal charges of this structure. The fluorine that shares a double bond with boron has six electrons around it (four from its two lone pairs of electrons and one each from its two bonds with boron). This is one less electron than the number of valence electrons it would have naturally (Group Seven elements have seven valence electrons), so it has a formal charge of +1. The two flourines that share single bonds with boron have seven electrons around them (six from their three lone pairs and one from their single bonds with boron). This is the same amount as the number of valence electrons they would have on their own, so they both have a formal charge of zero. Finally, boron has four electrons around it (one from each of its four bonds shared with fluorine). This is one more electron than the number of valence electrons that boron would have on its own, and as such boron has a formal charge of -1. This structure is supported by the fact that the experimentally determined bond length of the boron to fluorine bonds in BF 3 is less than what would be typical for a single bond (see Bond Order and Lengths). However, this structure contradicts one of the major rules of formal charges: Negative formal charges are supposed to be found on the more electronegative atom(s) in a bond, but in the structure depicted in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\), a positive formal charge is found on fluorine, which not only is the most electronegative element in the structure, but the most electronegative element in the entire periodic table (\\(\\chi=4.0\\)). Boron on the other hand, with the much lower electronegativity of 2.0, has the negative formal charge in this structure. This formal charge-electronegativity disagreement makes this double-bonded structure impossible. However the large electronegativity difference here, as opposed to in BH 3 , signifies significant polar bonds between boron and fluorine, which means there is a high ionic character to this molecule. This suggests the possibility of a semi-ionic structure such as seen in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\): None of these three structures is the \"correct\" structure in this instance. The most \"correct\" structure is most likely a resonance of all three structures: the one with the incomplete octet (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)), the one with the double bond (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)), and the one with the ionic bond (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\)). The most contributing structure is probably the incomplete octet structure (due to Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) being basically impossible and Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) not matching up with the behavior and properties of BF 3 ). As you can see even when other possibilities exist, incomplete octets may best portray a molecular structure. As a side note, it is important to note that BF 3 frequently bonds with a F - ion in order to form BF 4 - rather than staying as BF 3 . This structure completes boron's octet and it is more common in nature. This exemplifies the fact that incomplete octets are rare, and other configurations are typically more favorable, including bonding with additional ions as in the case of BF 3 . Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): \\(NF_3\\) Draw the Lewis structure for boron trifluoride (BF 3 ). Solution 1. Add electrons (3*7) + 3 = 24 2. Draw connectivities: 3. Add octets to outer atoms: 4. Add extra electrons (24-24=0) to central atom: 5. Does central electron have octet? NO. It has 6 electrons Add a multiple bond (double bond) to see if central atom can achieve an octet: 6. The central Boron now has an octet (there would be three resonance Lewis structures) However... In this structure with a double bond the fluorine atom is sharing extra electrons with the boron. The fluorine would have a '+' partial charge, and the boron a '-' partial charge, this is inconsistent with the electronegativities of fluorine and boron. Thus, the structure of BF 3 , with single bonds, and 6 valence electrons around the central boron is the most likely structure BF 3 reacts strongly with compounds which have an unshared pair of electrons which can be used to form a bond with the boron: Exception 3: Expanded Valence Shells More common than incomplete octets are expanded octets where the central atom in a Lewis structure has more than eight electrons in its valence shell. In expanded octets, the central atom can have ten electrons, or even twelve. Molecules with expanded octets involve highly electronegative terminal atoms, and a nonmetal central atom found in the third period or below , which those terminal atoms bond to. For example, \\(PCl_5\\) is a legitimate compound (whereas \\(NCl_5\\)) is not: Expanded valence shells are observed only for elements in period 3 (i.e. n=3) and beyond The 'octet' rule is based upon available n s and n p orbitals for valence electrons (2 electrons in the s orbitals, and 6 in the p orbitals). Beginning with the n=3 principle quantum number, the d orbitals become available ( l =2). The orbital diagram for the valence shell of phosphorous is: Hence, the third period elements occasionally exceed the octet rule by using their empty d orbitals to accommodate additional electrons. Size is also an important consideration: The larger the central atom, the larger the number of electrons which can surround it Expanded valence shells occur most often when the central atom is bonded to small electronegative atoms, such as F, Cl and O. There is currently much scientific exploration and inquiry into the reason why expanded valence shells are found. The top area of interest is figuring out where the extra pair(s) of electrons are found. Many chemists think that there is not a very large energy difference between the 3p and 3d orbitals, and as such it is plausible for extra electrons to easily fill the 3d orbital when an expanded octet is more favorable than having a complete octet. This matter is still under hot debate, however and there is even debate as to what makes an expanded octet more favorable than a configuration that follows the octet rule. One of the situations where expanded octet structures are treated as more favorable than Lewis structures that follow the octet rule is when the formal charges in the expanded octet structure are smaller than in a structure that adheres to the octet rule, or when there are less formal charges in the expanded octet than in the structure a structure that adheres to the octet rule. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): The \\(SO_4^{-2}\\) ion Such is the case for the sulfate ion, SO 4 -2 . A strict adherence to the octet rule forms the following Lewis structure: If we look at the formal charges on this molecule, we can see that all of the oxygen atoms have seven electrons around them (six from the three lone pairs and one from the bond with sulfur). This is one more electron than the number of valence electrons then they would have normally, and as such each of the oxygens in this structure has a formal charge of -1. Sulfur has four electrons around it in this structure (one from each of its four bonds) which is two electrons more than the number of valence electrons it would have normally, and as such it carries a formal charge of +2. If instead we made a structure for the sulfate ion with an expanded octet, it would look like this: Looking at the formal charges for this structure, the sulfur ion has six electrons around it (one from each of its bonds). This is the same amount as the number of valence electrons it would have naturally. This leaves sulfur with a formal charge of zero. The two oxygens that have double bonds to sulfur have six electrons each around them (four from the two lone pairs and one each from the two bonds with sulfur). This is the same amount of electrons as the number of valence electrons that oxygen atoms have on their own, and as such both of these oxygen atoms have a formal charge of zero. The two oxygens with the single bonds to sulfur have seven electrons around them in this structure (six from the three lone pairs and one from the bond to sulfur). That is one electron more than the number of valence electrons that oxygen would have on its own, and as such those two oxygens carry a formal charge of -1. Remember that with formal charges, the goal is to keep the formal charges (or the difference between the formal charges of each atom) as small as possible. The number of and values of the formal charges on this structure (-1 and 0 (difference of 1) in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{12}\\), as opposed to +2 and -1 (difference of 3) in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{12}\\)) is significantly lower than on the structure that follows the octet rule, and as such an expanded octet is plausible, and even preferred to a normal octet, in this case. Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): The \\(ICl_4^-\\) Ion Draw the Lewis structure for \\(ICl_4^-\\) ion. Solution 1. Count up the valence electrons: 7+(4*7)+1 = 36 electrons 2. Draw the connectivities: 3. Add octet of electrons to outer atoms: 4. Add extra electrons (36-32= 4 ) to central atom: 5. The ICl 4 - ion thus has 12 valence electrons around the central Iodine (in the 5 d orbitals) Expanded Lewis structures are also plausible depictions of molecules when experimentally determined bond lengths suggest partial double bond characters even when single bonds would already fully fill the octet of the central atom. Despite the cases for expanded octets, as mentioned for incomplete octets, it is important to keep in mind that, in general, the octet rule applies. Summary Following the Octet Rule for Lewis Dot Structures leads to the most accurate depictions of stable molecular and atomic structures and because of this we always want to use the octet rule when drawing Lewis Dot Structures. There are three exceptions: (1) When there are an odd number of valence electrons, (2) When there are too few valence electrons, and (3) when there are too many valence electrons References Petrucci, Ralph H.; Harwood, William S.; Herring, F.

         "Learning Objectives To assign a Lewis dot symbol to elements not having an octet of electrons in their compounds. Three cases can be constructed that do not follow the octet rule, and as such, they are known as the exceptions to the octet rule. Following the Octet Rule for Lewis Dot Structures leads to the most accurate depictions of stable molecular and atomic structures and because of this we always want to use the octet rule when drawing Lewis Dot Structures. However, it is hard to imagine that one rule could be followed by all molecules. There is always an exception, and in this case, three exceptions: When there are an odd number of valence electrons When there are too few valence electrons When there are too many valence electrons Exception 1: Species with Odd Numbers of Electrons The first exception to the Octet Rule is when there are an odd number of valence electrons. An example of this would be Nitrogen (II) Oxide also called nitric oxide (\\(\\ce{NO}\\). Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons while Oxygen has 6. The total would be 11 valence electrons to be used. The Octet Rule for this molecule is fulfilled in the above example, however that is with 10 valence electrons. The last one does not know where to go. The lone electron is called an unpaired electron. But where should the unpaired electron go? The unpaired electron is usually placed in the Lewis Dot Structure so that each element in the structure will have the lowest formal charge possible. The formal charge is the perceived charge on an individual atom in a molecule when atoms do not contribute equal numbers of electrons to the bonds they participate in . No formal charge at all is the most ideal situation. An example of a stable molecule with an odd number of valence electrons would be nitric oxide. nitric oxide has 11 valence electrons. If you need more information about formal charges, see Lewis Structures. If we were to imagine nitric oxide had ten valence electrons we would come up with the Lewis Structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)): Let's look at the formal charges of Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) based on this Lewis structure. Nitrogen normally has five valence electrons. In Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), it has two lone pair electrons and it participates in two bonds (a double bond) with oxygen. This results in nitrogen having a formal charge of +1. Oxygen normally has six valence electrons. In Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\), oxygen has four lone pair electrons and it participates in two bonds with nitrogen. Oxygen therefore has a formal charge of 0. The overall molecule here has a formal charge of +1 (+1 for nitrogen, 0 for oxygen. +1 + 0 = +1). However, if we add the eleventh electron to nitrogen (because we want the molecule to have the lowest total formal charge), it will bring both the nitrogen and the molecule's overall charges to zero, the most ideal formal charge situation. That is exactly what is done to get the correct Lewis structure for nitric oxide (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)): Free Radicals There are actually very few stable molecules with odd numbers of electrons that exist, since that unpaired electron is willing to react with other unpaired electrons. Most odd electron species are highly reactive, which we call Free Radicals. Because of their instability, free radicals bond to atoms in which they can take an electron from in order to become stable, making them very chemically reactive. Radicals are found as both reactants and products, but generally react to form more stable molecules as soon as they can. In order to emphasize the existence of the unpaired electron, radicals are denoted with a dot in front of their chemical symbol as with \\(\\cdot OH\\), the hydroxyl radical. An example of a radical you may by familiar with already is the gaseous chlorine atom, denoted \\(\\cdot Cl\\). Interestingly, an odd Number of Valence Electrons will result in the molecule being paramagnetic. Exception 2: Incomplete Octets The second exception to the Octet Rule is when there are too few valence electrons that results in an incomplete Octet. There are even more occasions where the octet rule does not give the most correct depiction of a molecule or ion. This is also the case with incomplete octets. Species with incomplete octets are pretty rare and generally are only found in some beryllium, aluminum, and boron compounds including the boron hydrides. Let's take a look at one such hydride, BH 3 (Borane). If one were to make a Lewis structure for BH 3 following the basic strategies for drawing Lewis structures, one would probably come up with this structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)): The problem with this structure is that boron has an incomplete octet; it only has six electrons around it. Hydrogen atoms can naturally only have only 2 electrons in their outermost shell (their version of an octet), and as such there are no spare electrons to form a double bond with boron. One might surmise that the failure of this structure to form complete octets must mean that this bond should be ionic instead of covalent. However, boron has an electronegativity that is very similar to hydrogen, meaning there is likely very little ionic character in the hydrogen to boron bonds, and as such this Lewis structure, though it does not fulfill the octet rule, is likely the best structure possible for depicting BH 3 with Lewis theory. One of the things that may account for BH 3 's incomplete octet is that it is commonly a transitory species, formed temporarily in reactions that involve multiple steps. Let's take a look at another incomplete octet situation dealing with boron, BF 3 (Boron trifluorine). Like with BH 3 , the initial drawing of a Lewis structure of BF 3 will form a structure where boron has only six electrons around it (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)). If you look Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\), you can see that the fluorine atoms possess extra lone pairs that they can use to make additional bonds with boron, and you might think that all you have to do is make one lone pair into a bond and the structure will be correct. If we add one double bond between boron and one of the fluorines we get the following Lewis Structure (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)): Each fluorine has eight electrons, and the boron atom has eight as well! Each atom has a perfect octet, right? Not so fast. We must examine the formal charges of this structure. The fluorine that shares a double bond with boron has six electrons around it (four from its two lone pairs of electrons and one each from its two bonds with boron). This is one less electron than the number of valence electrons it would have naturally (Group Seven elements have seven valence electrons), so it has a formal charge of +1. The two flourines that share single bonds with boron have seven electrons around them (six from their three lone pairs and one from their single bonds with boron). This is the same amount as the number of valence electrons they would have on their own, so they both have a formal charge of zero. Finally, boron has four electrons around it (one from each of its four bonds shared with fluorine). This is one more electron than the number of valence electrons that boron would have on its own, and as such boron has a formal charge of -1. This structure is supported by the fact that the experimentally determined bond length of the boron to fluorine bonds in BF 3 is less than what would be typical for a single bond (see Bond Order and Lengths). However, this structure contradicts one of the major rules of formal charges: Negative formal charges are supposed to be found on the more electronegative atom(s) in a bond, but in the structure depicted in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\), a positive formal charge is found on fluorine, which not only is the most electronegative element in the structure, but the most electronegative element in the entire periodic table (\\(\\chi=4.0\\)). Boron on the other hand, with the much lower electronegativity of 2.0, has the negative formal charge in this structure. This formal charge-electronegativity disagreement makes this double-bonded structure impossible. However the large electronegativity difference here, as opposed to in BH 3 , signifies significant polar bonds between boron and fluorine, which means there is a high ionic character to this molecule. This suggests the possibility of a semi-ionic structure such as seen in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\): None of these three structures is the \"correct\" structure in this instance. The most \"correct\" structure is most likely a resonance of all three structures: the one with the incomplete octet (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)), the one with the double bond (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)), and the one with the ionic bond (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\)). The most contributing structure is probably the incomplete octet structure (due to Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) being basically impossible and Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) not matching up with the behavior and properties of BF 3 ). As you can see even when other possibilities exist, incomplete octets may best portray a molecular structure. As a side note, it is important to note that BF 3 frequently bonds with a F - ion in order to form BF 4 - rather than staying as BF 3 . This structure completes boron's octet and it is more common in nature. This exemplifies the fact that incomplete octets are rare, and other configurations are typically more favorable, including bonding with additional ions as in the case of BF 3 . Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): \\(NF_3\\) Draw the Lewis structure for boron trifluoride (BF 3 ). Solution 1. Add electrons (3*7) + 3 = 24 2. Draw connectivities: 3. Add octets to outer atoms: 4. Add extra electrons (24-24=0) to central atom: 5. Does central electron have octet? NO. It has 6 electrons Add a multiple bond (double bond) to see if central atom can achieve an octet: 6.

         "Learning Objectives To describe how a covalent bond forms. To apply the octet rule to covalent compounds You have already seen examples of substances that contain covalent bonds. One substance mentioned previously was water (\\(\\ce{H2O}\\)). You can tell from its formula that it is not an ionic compound; it is not composed of a metal and a nonmetal. Consequently, its properties are different from those of ionic compounds. Electron Sharing Previously, we discussed ionic bonding where electrons can be transferred from one atom to another so that both atoms have an energy-stable outer electron shell. Because most filled electron shells have eight electrons in them, chemists called this tendency the octet rule. However, there is another way an atom can achieve a full valence shell: atoms can share electrons. This concept can be illustrated by using two hydrogen atoms, each of which has a single electron in its valence shell. (For small atoms such as hydrogen atoms, the valence shell will be the first shell, which holds only two electrons.) We can represent the two individual hydrogen atoms as follows: In contrast, when two hydrogen atoms get close enough together to share their electrons, they can be represented as follows: By sharing their valence electrons, both hydrogen atoms now have two electrons in their respective valence shells. Because each valence shell is now filled, this arrangement is more stable than when the two atoms are separate. The sharing of electrons between atoms is called a covalent bond, and the two electrons that join atoms in a covalent bond are called a bonding pair of electrons. A discrete group of atoms connected by covalent bonds is called a molecule—the smallest part of a compound that retains the chemical identity of that compound. Chemists frequently use Lewis diagrams to represent covalent bonding in molecular substances. For example, the Lewis diagrams of two separate hydrogen atoms are as follows: The Lewis diagram of two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons looks like this: This depiction of molecules is simplified further by using a dash to represent a covalent bond. The hydrogen molecule is then represented as follows: Remember that the dash, also referred to as a single bond, represents a pair of electrons. The bond in a hydrogen molecule, measured as the distance between the two nuclei, is about 7.4 × 10 −11 m, or 74 picometers (pm; 1 pm = 1 × 10 −12 m). This particular bond length represents a balance between several forces: the attractions between oppositely charged electrons and nuclei, the repulsion between two negatively charged electrons, and the repulsion between two positively charged nuclei. If the nuclei were closer together, they would repel each other more strongly; if the nuclei were farther apart, there would be less attraction between the positive and negative particles. Fluorine is another element whose atoms bond together in pairs to form diatomic (two-atom) molecules. Two separate fluorine atoms have the following electron dot diagrams: Each fluorine atom contributes one valence electron, making a single bond and giving each atom a complete valence shell, which fulfills the octet rule: The circles show that each fluorine atom has eight electrons around it. As with hydrogen, we can represent the fluorine molecule with a dash in place of the bonding electrons: Each fluorine atom has six electrons, or three pairs of electrons, that are not participating in the covalent bond. Rather than being shared, they are considered to belong to a single atom. These are called nonbonding pairs (or lone pairs) of electrons. Covalent Bonds between Different Atoms Now that we have looked at electron sharing between atoms of the same element, let us look at covalent bond formation between atoms of different elements. Consider a molecule composed of one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom: Each atom needs one additional electron to complete its valence shell. By each contributing one electron, they make the following molecule: In this molecule, the hydrogen atom does not have nonbonding electrons, while the fluorine atom has six nonbonding electrons (three lone electron pairs). The circles show how the valence electron shells are filled for both atoms. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Use Lewis diagrams to indicate the formation of the following: Cl 2 HBr Solution a. When two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons. In Cl 2 molecule, each chlorine atom is surrounded by an octet number of electrons. The Lewis diagram for a Cl 2 molecule is similar to the one for F 2 (shown above). b. When a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom form HBr, they share one pair of electrons. In the HBr molecule, H achieves a full valence of two electrons ( duet ) while Br achieves an octet . The Lewis diagram for HBr is similar to that for HF shown above. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Draw the Lewis diagram for each compound. a molecule composed of one chlorine atom and one fluorine atom a molecule composed of one hydrogen atom and one iodine atom Answer a: Answer b: Covalent Bonds in Larger Molecules The formation of a water molecule from two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can be illustrated using Lewis dot symbols (shown below). The structure on the right is the Lewis electron structure , or Lewis structure , for \\(\\ce{H2O}\\). With two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, the oxygen atom has now completed its octet . Moreover, by sharing a bonding pair with oxygen, each hydrogen atom now has a full valence shell of two electrons. Chemists usually indicate a bonding pair by a single line, as shown (below). Other large molecules are constructed in a similar fashion, with some atoms participating in more than one covalent bond. For example, methane (\\(\\ce{CH4}\\)), the central carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms, can be represented using either of the Lewis structures below. Again, sharing electrons between C and H atoms results in C achieving and octet while H achieving a duet number of electrons. How Many Covalent Bonds Are Formed? The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons). In the Lewis structure, the number of bonds formed by an element in a neutral compound is the same as the number of unpaired electrons it must share with other atoms to complete its octet of electrons. For example, each atom of a group 4A (14) element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds , as illustrated here for carbon in CH 4 (methane). Group 5A (15) elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds , as in NH 3 (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 6A (16) obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds . Fluorine and the other halogens in group 7A (17) have seven valence electrons and can obtain an octet by forming one covalent bond . Typically, the atoms of group 4A form 4 covalent bonds; group 5A form 3 bonds; group 6A form 2 bonds; and group 7A form one bond. The number of electrons required to obtain an octet determines the number of covalent bonds an atom can form. This is summarized in the table below. In each case, the sum of the number of bonds and the number of lone pairs is 4, which is equivalent to eight (octet) electrons. Atom (Group number) Number of Bonds Number of Lone Pairs Carbon (Group 14 or 4A) 4 0 Nitrogen (Group 15 or 5A) 3 1 Oxygen (Group 16 or 6A) 2 2 Fluorine (Group 17 or 7A) 1 3 Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it follows the duet rule. It is an exception to the octet rule. Hydrogen only needs to form one bond. This is the reason why H is always a terminal atom and never a central atom. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) shows the number of covalent bonds various atoms typically form. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule since they have d and f electrons involved in their valence shells. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) Examine the Lewis structure of OF 2 below. Count the number of bonds formed by each element. Based on the element's location in the periodic table, does it correspond to the expected number of bonds shown in Table 4.1? Does the Lewis structure below follow the octet rule? Solution Yes. F (group 7A) forms one bond and O (group 6A) forms 2 bonds. Each atom is surrounded by 8 electrons. This structure satisfies the octet rule. Examine the Lewis structure of NCl 3 below. Count the number of bonds formed by each element. Based on the element's location in the periodic table, does it correspond to the expected number of bonds shown in Table 4.1? Does the Lewis structure below follow the octet rule? Answer Both Cl and N form the expected number of bonds. Cl (group 7A) has one bond and 3 lone pairs. The central atom N (group 5A) has 3 bonds and one lone pair. Yes, the Lewis structure of NCl 3 follows the octet rule. Key Takeaways A covalent bond is formed between two atoms by sharing electrons. The number of bonds an element forms in a covalent compound is determined by the number of electrons it needs to reach octet. Hydrogen is an exception to the octet rule. H forms only one bond because it needs only two electrons.",
         "Learning Objectives To describe how a covalent bond forms. To apply the octet rule to covalent compounds You have already seen examples of substances that contain covalent bonds. One substance mentioned previously was water (\\(\\ce{H2O}\\)). You can tell from its formula that it is not an ionic compound; it is not composed of a metal and a nonmetal. Consequently, its properties are different from those of ionic compounds. Electron Sharing Previously, we discussed ionic bonding where electrons can be transferred from one atom to another so that both atoms have an energy-stable outer electron shell. Because most filled electron shells have eight electrons in them, chemists called this tendency the octet rule. However, there is another way an atom can achieve a full valence shell: atoms can share electrons. This concept can be illustrated by using two hydrogen atoms, each of which has a single electron in its valence shell. (For small atoms such as hydrogen atoms, the valence shell will be the first shell, which holds only two electrons.) We can represent the two individual hydrogen atoms as follows: In contrast, when two hydrogen atoms get close enough together to share their electrons, they can be represented as follows: By sharing their valence electrons, both hydrogen atoms now have two electrons in their respective valence shells. Because each valence shell is now filled, this arrangement is more stable than when the two atoms are separate. The sharing of electrons between atoms is called a covalent bond, and the two electrons that join atoms in a covalent bond are called a bonding pair of electrons. A discrete group of atoms connected by covalent bonds is called a molecule—the smallest part of a compound that retains the chemical identity of that compound. Chemists frequently use Lewis diagrams to represent covalent bonding in molecular substances. For example, the Lewis diagrams of two separate hydrogen atoms are as follows: The Lewis diagram of two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons looks like this: This depiction of molecules is simplified further by using a dash to represent a covalent bond. The hydrogen molecule is then represented as follows: Remember that the dash, also referred to as a single bond, represents a pair of electrons. The bond in a hydrogen molecule, measured as the distance between the two nuclei, is about 7.4 × 10 −11 m, or 74 picometers (pm; 1 pm = 1 × 10 −12 m). This particular bond length represents a balance between several forces: the attractions between oppositely charged electrons and nuclei, the repulsion between two negatively charged electrons, and the repulsion between two positively charged nuclei. If the nuclei were closer together, they would repel each other more strongly; if the nuclei were farther apart, there would be less attraction between the positive and negative particles. Fluorine is another element whose atoms bond together in pairs to form diatomic (two-atom) molecules. Two separate fluorine atoms have the following electron dot diagrams: Each fluorine atom contributes one valence electron, making a single bond and giving each atom a complete valence shell, which fulfills the octet rule: The circles show that each fluorine atom has eight electrons around it. As with hydrogen, we can represent the fluorine molecule with a dash in place of the bonding electrons: Each fluorine atom has six electrons, or three pairs of electrons, that are not participating in the covalent bond. Rather than being shared, they are considered to belong to a single atom. These are called nonbonding pairs (or lone pairs) of electrons. Covalent Bonds between Different Atoms Now that we have looked at electron sharing between atoms of the same element, let us look at covalent bond formation between atoms of different elements. Consider a molecule composed of one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom: Each atom needs one additional electron to complete its valence shell. By each contributing one electron, they make the following molecule: In this molecule, the hydrogen atom does not have nonbonding electrons, while the fluorine atom has six nonbonding electrons (three lone electron pairs). The circles show how the valence electron shells are filled for both atoms. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Use Lewis diagrams to indicate the formation of the following: Cl 2 HBr Solution a. When two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons. In Cl 2 molecule, each chlorine atom is surrounded by an octet number of electrons. The Lewis diagram for a Cl 2 molecule is similar to the one for F 2 (shown above). b. When a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom form HBr, they share one pair of electrons. In the HBr molecule, H achieves a full valence of two electrons ( duet ) while Br achieves an octet . The Lewis diagram for HBr is similar to that for HF shown above. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Draw the Lewis diagram for each compound. a molecule composed of one chlorine atom and one fluorine atom a molecule composed of one hydrogen atom and one iodine atom Answer a: Answer b: Covalent Bonds in Larger Molecules The formation of a water molecule from two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can be illustrated using Lewis dot symbols (shown below).

         "Learning Objectives Recognize composition, decomposition, and combustion reactions. Predict the products of a combustion reaction. Three classifications of chemical reactions will be reviewed in this section. Predicting the products in some of them may be difficult, but the reactions are still easy to recognize. A composition reaction (sometimes also called a combination reaction or a synthesis reaction ) produces a single substance from multiple reactants. A single substance as a product is the key characteristic of the composition reaction. There may be a coefficient other than one for the substance, but if the reaction has only a single substance as a product, it can be called a composition reaction. In the reaction \\[\\ce{2H_2(g) + O_2(g) → 2H_2O(ℓ)}\\nonumber \\] water is produced from hydrogen and oxygen. Although there are two molecules of water being produced, there is only one substance—water—as a product. So this is a composition reaction. A decomposition reaction starts from a single substance and produces more than one substance; that is, it decomposes. The key characteristics of a decomposition reaction are: one substance as a reactant and more than one substance as the products. For example, in the decomposition of sodium hydrogen carbonate (also known as sodium bicarbonate): \\[\\ce{2NaHCO_3(s) → Na_2CO_3(s) + CO_2(g) + H_2O(ℓ) }\\nonumber \\] sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water are produced from the single substance sodium hydrogen carbonate.

         "Learning Objectives To predict the properties of gases using the gas laws. Experience has shown that several properties of a gas can be related to each other under certain conditions. The properties are pressure ( P ), volume ( V ), temperature ( T , in kelvins), and amount of material expressed in moles ( n ). What we find is that a sample of gas cannot have any random values for these properties. Instead, only certain values, dictated by some simple mathematical relationships, will occur. Boyle’s Law The first simple relationship, referred to as a gas law, is between the pressure of a gas and its volume. If the amount of gas in a sample and its temperature are kept constant, then as the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume of the gas decreases proportionately. Mathematically, this is written as \\[\\mathrm{P \\propto \\dfrac{1}{V}} \\nonumber \\] where the “∝” symbol means “is proportional to.” This is one form of Boyle’s law, which relates the pressure of a gas to its volume. A more useful form of Boyle’s law involves a change in conditions of a gas. For a given amount of gas at a constant temperature, if we know the initial pressure and volume of a gas sample and the pressure or volume changes, we can calculate what the new volume or pressure will be. That form of Boyle’s law is written \\[P_iV_i = P_fV_f \\label{Eq1} \\] where the subscript \\(i\\) refers to initial conditions and the subscript \\(f\\) refers to final conditions. To use \\(\\ref{Eq1}\\), you need to know any three of the variables so that you can algebraically calculate the fourth variable. Also, the pressure quantities must have the same units, as must the two volume quantities. If the two similar variables don’t have the same variables, one value must be converted to the other value’s unit. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Increasing Pressure in a Gas What happens to the volume of a gas if its pressure is increased? Assume all other conditions remain the same. Solution If the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume decreases in response. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Increasing Volume in a Gas What happens to the pressure of a gas if its volume is increased? Assume all other conditions remain the same. Answer If the volume of a gas is increased, the pressure decreases. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): Gas Compression If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is reduced to 0.987 atm? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Solution The key in problems like this is to be able to identify which quantities represent which variables from the relevant equation. The way the question is worded, you should be able to tell that 1.56 atm is P i , 7.02 L is V i , and 0.987 atm is P f . What we are looking for is the final volume— V f . Therefore, substituting these values into P i V i = P f V f : (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (0.987 atm) × V f The expression has atmospheres on both sides of the equation, so they cancel algebraically: (1.56)(7.02 L) = (0.987) × V f Now we divide both sides of the expression by 0.987 to isolate V f , the quantity we are seeking: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(1.56)(7.02\\: L)}{0.987}=V_f}\\) Performing the multiplication and division, we get the value of V f , which is 11.1 L. The volume increases. This should make sense because the pressure decreases, so pressure and volume are inversely related. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 3.66 atm and an initial volume of 11.8 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is reduced to 5.09 L? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Answer 8.48 atm If the units of similar quantities are not the same, one of them must be converted to the other quantity’s units for the calculation to work out properly. It does not matter which quantity is converted to a different unit; the only thing that matters is that the conversion and subsequent algebra are performed properly. The following example illustrates this process. Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is changed to 1,775 torr? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Solution This example is similar to Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\), except now the final pressure is expressed in torr. For the math to work out properly, one of the pressure values must be converted to the other unit. Let us change the initial pressure to torr: \\(\\mathrm{1.56\\: atm\\times\\dfrac{760\\: torr}{1\\: atm}=1,190\\: torr}\\) Now we can use Boyle’s law: (1,190 torr)(7.02 L) = (1,775 torr) × V f Torr cancels algebraically from both sides of the equation, leaving (1,190)(7.02 L) = (1,775) × V f Now we divide both sides of the equation by 1,775 to isolate V f on one side. Solving for the final volume, \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1,190)(7.02\\: L)}{1,775}=4.71\\: L}\\) Because the pressure increases, it makes sense that the volume decreases. The answer for the final volume is essentially the same if we converted the 1,775 torr to atmospheres: \\(\\mathrm{1,775\\: torr\\times\\dfrac{1\\: atm}{760\\: torr}=2.336\\: atm}\\). Using Boyle’s law: (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (2.335 atm) × V f ; \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1.56\\: atm)(7.02\\: L)}{2.336\\: atm}=4.69\\: L}\\). Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 375 torr and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is changed to 4,577 mL? Does the answer make sense? Assume that amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Answer 575 torr To Your Health: Breathing Breathing certainly is a major contribution to your health! Without breathing, we could not survive. Curiously, the act of breathing itself is little more than an application of Boyle’s law. The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called alveoli. It is in the alveoli that oxygen from the air transfers to the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream transfers to the lungs for exhalation. For air to move in and out of the lungs, the pressure inside the lungs must change, forcing the lungs to change volume—just as predicted by Boyle’s law. The pressure change is caused by the diaphragm, a muscle that covers the bottom of the lungs. When the diaphragm moves down, it expands the size of our lungs. When this happens, the air pressure inside our lungs decreases slightly. This causes new air to rush in, and we inhale. The pressure decrease is slight—only 3 torr, or about 0.4% of an atmosphere. We inhale only 0.5–1.0 L of air per normal breath. Exhaling air requires that we relax the diaphragm, which pushes against the lungs and slightly decreases the volume of the lungs. This slightly increases the pressure of the air in the lungs, and air is forced out; we exhale. Only 1–2 torr of extra pressure is needed to exhale. So with every breath, our own bodies are performing an experimental test of Boyle’s law. Charles’s Law Another simple gas law relates the volume of a gas to its temperature. Experiments indicate that as the temperature of a gas sample is increased, its volume increases as long as the pressure and the amount of gas remain constant. The way to write this mathematically is \\[\\mathrm V \\propto T \\nonumber \\] At this point, the concept of temperature must be clarified. Although the Kelvin scale is the preferred temperature scale, the Celsius scale is also a common temperature scale used in science. The Celsius scale is based on the melting and boiling points of water and is actually the common temperature scale used by most countries around the world (except for the United States, which still uses the Fahrenheit scale). The value of a Celsius temperature is directly related to its Kelvin value by a simple expression: Kelvin temperature = Celsius temperature + 273 Thus, it is easy to convert from one temperature scale to another. The Kelvin scale is sometimes referred to as the absolute scale because the zero point on the Kelvin scale is at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. On the other temperature scales, absolute zero is −260°C or −459°F. The expression relating a gas volume to its temperature begs the following question: to which temperature scale is the volume of a gas related? The answer is that gas volumes are directly related to the Kelvin temperature . Therefore, the temperature of a gas sample should always be expressed in (or converted to) a Kelvin temperature. Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Increasing Temperature What happens to the volume of a gas if its temperature is decreased? Assume that all other conditions remain constant. Solution If the temperature of a gas sample is decreased, the volume decreases as well. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) What happens to the temperature of a gas if its volume is increased? Assume that all other conditions remain constant. Answer The temperature increases. As with Boyle’s law, the relationship between volume and temperature can be expressed in terms of initial and final values of volume and temperature, as follows: \\[\\mathrm{\\dfrac{V_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{V_f}{T_f}} \\nonumber \\] where V i and T i are the initial volume and temperature, and V f and T f are the final volume and temperature. This is Charles’s law. The restriction on its use is that the pressure of the gas and the amount of gas must remain constant. (Charles’s law is sometimes referred to as Gay-Lussac’s law, after the scientist who promoted Charles’s work.) Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) A gas sample at 20°C has an initial volume of 20.0 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to 60°C? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant. Solution Although the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, we must convert them to the kelvins before we can use Charles’s law. Thus, 20°C + 273 = 293 K = T i 60°C + 273 = 333 K = T f Now we can substitute these values into Charles’s law, along with the initial volume of 20.0 L: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{20.0\\: L}{293\\: K}=\\dfrac{V_f}{333\\: K}}\\) Multiplying the 333 K to the other side of the equation, we see that our temperature units will cancel: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(333\\: K)(20.0\\: L)}{293\\: K}=V_f}\\) Solving for the final volume, V f = 22.7 L. So, as the temperature is increased, the volume increases. This makes sense because volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (as long as the pressure and the amount of the remain constant). Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) A gas sample at 35°C has an initial volume of 5.06 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to −35°C? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant. Answer 3.91 L Combined Gas Law Other gas laws can be constructed, but we will focus on only two more. The combined gas law brings Boyle’s and Charles’s laws together to relate pressure, volume, and temperature changes of a gas sample: \\[\\mathrm{\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{T_f}} \\nonumber \\] To apply this gas law, the amount of gas should remain constant. As with the other gas laws, the temperature must be expressed in kelvins, and the units on the similar quantities should be the same. Because of the dependence on three quantities at the same time, it is difficult to tell in advance what will happen to one property of a gas sample as two other properties change. The best way to know is to work it out mathematically. Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) A sample of gas has P i = 1.50 atm, V i = 10.5 L, and T i = 300 K. What is the final volume if P f = 0.750 atm and T f = 350 K? Solution Using the combined gas law, substitute for five of the quantities: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(1.50\\: atm)(10.5\\: L)}{300\\: K}=\\dfrac{(0.750\\: atm)(V_f)}{350\\: K}}\\) We algebraically rearrange this expression to isolate V f on one side of the equation: \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1.50\\: atm)(10.5\\: L)(350\\: K)}{(300\\: K)(0.750\\: atm)}=24.5\\: L}\\) Note how all the units cancel except the unit for volume. A sample of gas has P i = 0.768 atm, V i = 10.5 L, and T i = 300 K. What is the final pressure if V f = 7.85 L and T f = 250 K? Answer 0.856 atm Example \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\) A balloon containing a sample of gas has a temperature of 22°C and a pressure of 1.09 atm in an airport in Cleveland. The balloon has a volume of 1,070 mL. The balloon is transported by plane to Denver, where the temperature is 11°C and the pressure is 655 torr. What is the new volume of the balloon? Solution The first task is to convert all quantities to the proper and consistent units. The temperatures must be expressed in kelvins, and the pressure units are different so one of the quantities must be converted. Let us convert the atmospheres to torr: 22°C + 273 = 295 K = T i 11°C + 273 = 284 K = T f \\(\\mathrm{1.09\\: atm\\times\\dfrac{760\\: torr}{1\\: atm}=828\\: torr = P_i}\\) Now we can substitute the quantities into the combined has law: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(828\\: torr)(1,070\\: mL)}{295\\: K}=\\dfrac{(655\\: torr)\\times V_f}{284\\: K}}\\) To solve for V f , we multiply the 284 K in the denominator of the right side into the numerator on the left, and we divide 655 torr in the numerator of the right side into the denominator on the left: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(828\\: torr)(1,070\\: mL)(284\\: K)}{(295\\: K)(655\\: torr)}=V_f}\\) Notice that torr and kelvins cancel, as they are found in both the numerator and denominator. The only unit that remains is milliliters, which is a unit of volume. So V f = 1,300 mL. The overall change is that the volume of the balloon has increased by 230 mL. A balloon used to lift weather instruments into the atmosphere contains gas having a volume of 1,150 L on the ground, where the pressure is 0.977 atm and the temperature is 18°C. Aloft, this gas has a pressure of 6.88 torr and a temperature of −15°C. What is the new volume of the gas? Answer 110,038 L The Ideal Gas Law So far, the gas laws we have used have focused on changing one or more properties of the gas, such as its volume, pressure, or temperature. There is one gas law that relates all the independent properties of a gas under any particular condition, rather than a change in conditions. This gas law is called the ideal gas law. The formula of this law is as follows: PV = nRT In this equation, P is pressure, V is volume, n is amount of moles, and T is temperature. R is called the ideal gas law constant and is a proportionality constant that relates the values of pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas sample. The variables in this equation do not have the subscripts i and f to indicate an initial condition and a final condition. The ideal gas law relates the four independent properties of a gas under any conditions. The value of R depends on what units are used to express the other quantities. If volume is expressed in liters and pressure in atmospheres, then the proper value of R is as follows: \\[\\mathrm{R=0.08205 \\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}} \\nonumber \\] This may seem like a strange unit, but that is what is required for the units to work out algebraically. Example \\(\\PageIndex{8}\\) What is the volume in liters of 1.45 mol of N 2 gas at 298 K and 3.995 atm? Solution Using the ideal gas law where P = 3.995 atm, n = 1.45, and T = 298, \\(\\mathrm{(3.995\\: atm)\\times V=(1.45\\: mol)\\left(0.08205\\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}\\right)(298\\: K)}\\) On the right side, the moles and kelvins cancel. Also, because atmospheres appear in the numerator on both sides of the equation, they also cancel. The only remaining unit is liters, a unit of volume. So 3.995 × V = (1.45)(0.08205)(298) L Dividing both sides of the equation by 3.995 and evaluating, we get V = 8.87 L. Note that the conditions of the gas are not changing. Rather, the ideal gas law allows us to determine what the fourth property of a gas (here, volume) must be if three other properties (here, amount, pressure, and temperature) are known. What is the pressure of a sample of CO 2 gas if 0.557 mol is held in a 20.0 L container at 451 K? Answer 1.03 atm For convenience, scientists have selected 273 K (0°C) and 1.00 atm pressure as a set of standard conditions for gases. This combination of conditions is called standard temperature and pressure (STP). Under these conditions, 1 mol of any gas has about the same volume. We can use the ideal gas law to determine the volume of 1 mol of gas at STP: \\[\\mathrm{(1.00\\: atm)\\times V=(1.00\\: mol)\\left(0.08205\\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}\\right)(273\\: K)} \\nonumber \\] This volume is 22.4 L. Because this volume is independent of the identity of a gas, the idea that 1 mol of gas has a volume of 22.4 L at STP makes a convenient conversion factor: 1 mol gas = 22.4 L (at STP) Example \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\) Cyclopropane (C 3 H 6 ) is a gas that formerly was used as an anesthetic. How many moles of gas are there in a 100.0 L sample if the gas is at STP? Solution We can set up a simple, one-step conversion that relates moles and liters: \\(\\mathrm{100.0\\: L\\: C_3H_6\\times \\dfrac{1\\: mol}{22.4\\: L}=4.46\\: mol\\: C_3H_6}\\) There are almost 4.5 mol of gas in 100.0 L. Note: Because of its flammability, cyclopropane is no longer used as an anesthetic gas. Freon is a trade name for a series of fluorine- and chlorine-containing gases that formerly were used in refrigeration systems. What volume does 8.75 mol of Freon have at STP? Note: Many gases known as Freon are no longer used because their presence in the atmosphere destroys the ozone layer, which protects us from ultraviolet light from the sun. Answer 196 L Airbags Airbags (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)) are a safety feature provided in most automobiles since the 1990s. The effective operation of an airbag requires that it be rapidly inflated with an appropriate amount (volume) of gas when the vehicle is involved in a collision. This requirement is satisfied in many automotive airbag systems through use of explosive chemical reactions, one common choice being the decomposition of sodium azide, NaN 3 . When sensors in the vehicle detect a collision, an electrical current is passed through a carefully measured amount of NaN 3 to initiate its decomposition: \\[\\ce{2NaN3}(s)\\rightarrow \\ce{3N2}(g)+\\ce{2Na}(s) \\nonumber \\] This reaction is very rapid, generating gaseous nitrogen that can deploy and fully inflate a typical airbag in a fraction of a second (~0.03–0.1 s). Among many engineering considerations, the amount of sodium azide used must be appropriate for generating enough nitrogen gas to fully inflate the air bag and ensure its proper function. For example, a small mass (~100 g) of NaN 3 will generate approximately 50 L of N 2 . Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures The ideal gas equation of state applies to mixtures just as to pure gases. It was in fact with a gas mixture, ordinary air, that Boyle, Gay-Lussac and Charles did their early experiments. The only new concept we need in order to deal with gas mixtures is the partial pressure , a concept invented by the famous English chemist John Dalton (1766-1844). Dalton reasoned that the low density and high compressibility of gases indicates that they consist mostly of empty space; from this it follows that when two or more different gases occupy the same volume, they behave entirely independently. The contribution that each component of a gaseous mixture makes to the total pressure of the gas is known as the partial pressure of that gas. The definition of Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures that address this is: The total pressure of a gas is the sum of the partial pressures of its components which is expressed algebraically as \\[P_{total}=P_1+P_2+P_3 ... = \\sum_i P_i \\nonumber \\] or, equivalently \\[ P_{total} = \\dfrac{RT}{V} \\sum_i n_i \\nonumber \\] There is also a similar relationship based on volume fractions , known as Amagat's law of partial volumes . It is exactly analogous to Dalton's law, in that it states that the total volume of a mixture is just the sum of the partial volumes of its components. But there are two important differences: Amagat's law holds only for ideal gases which must all be at the same temperature and pressure. Dalton's law has neither of these restrictions. Although Amagat's law seems intuitively obvious, it sometimes proves useful in chemical engineering applications. We will make no use of it in this course. Example \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\) Three flasks having different volumes and containing different gases at various pressures are connected by stopcocks as shown. When the stopcocks are opened, What will be the pressure in the system? Which gas will be most abundant in the mixture? Assume that the temperature is uniform and that the volume of the connecting tubes is negligible. Solution The trick here is to note that the total number of moles n T and the temperature remain unchanged, so we can make use of Boyle's law PV = constant. We will work out the details for CO 2 only, denoted by subscripts a. For CO 2 , \\[P_aV_a = (2.13\\; atm)(1.50\\; L) = 3.20\\; L \\cdot atm \\nonumber \\] Adding the PV products for each separate container, we obtain \\[A\\sum_i P_i V_i = 6.36\\; L \\cdot atm = n_T RT \\nonumber \\] We will call this sum P 1 V 1 . After the stopcocks have been opened and the gases mix, the new conditions are denoted by P 2 V 2 . From Boyle's law (\\(\\ref{Eq1}\\), \\[P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 = 6.36\\; L \\cdot atm \\nonumber \\] \\[V_2 = \\sum_i V_i = 4.50\\; L \\nonumber \\] Solving for the final pressure P 2 we obtain (6.36 L-atm)/(4.50 L) = 1.41 atm . For part (b) , note that the number of moles of each gas is n = PV/RT . The mole fraction of any one gas is X i = n i / n T . For CO 2 , this works out to (3.19/ RT ) / (6.36/ RT ) = 0.501. Because this exceeds 0.5, we know that this is the most abundant gas in the final mixture. Dalton’s law states that in a gas mixture (\\(P_{total}\\)) each gas will exert a pressure independent of the other gases (\\(P_n\\)) and each gas will behave as if it alone occupies the total volume. By extension, the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated by multiplying the total pressure (\\(P_{total}\\)) by the gas percentage (%). \\[P_{Total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 + ... + P_n \\nonumber \\] or \\[P_n = \\dfrac{\\text{% of individual gas}_n}{P_{Total}} \\nonumber \\] Gas Partial Pressure (mm Hg) Percentage (%) Nitrogen, (N_2\\) \\(P_{N_2}\\) = 594 78.000 Oxygen, \\(O_2\\) \\(P_{O_2}\\)= 160 21.000 Carbon Dioxide, \\(CO_2\\) \\(P_{CO_2}\\) = 0.25 0.033 Water Vapor, \\(H_2O\\) \\(P_{H_2O}\\) = 5.7 0.750 Other trace gases \\(P_{Other}\\) = 0.05 0.220 Total air \\(P_{Total}\\) = 760 1.000 Application of Dalton's Law: Collecting Gases over Water A common laboratory method of collecting the gaseous product of a chemical reaction is to conduct it into an inverted tube or bottle filled with water, the opening of which is immersed in a larger container of water. This arrangement is called a pneumatic trough , and was widely used in the early days of chemistry. As the gas enters the bottle it displaces the water and becomes trapped in the upper part. The volume of the gas can be observed by means of a calibrated scale on the bottle, but what about its pressure? The total pressure confining the gas is just that of the atmosphere transmitting its force through the water. (An exact calculation would also have to take into account the height of the water column in the inverted tube.) But liquid water itself is always in equilibrium with its vapor, so the space in the top of the tube is a mixture of two gases: the gas being collected, and gaseous H 2 O. The partial pressure of H 2 O is known as the vapor pressure of water and it depends on the temperature. In order to determine the quantity of gas we have collected, we must use Dalton's Law to find the partial pressure of that gas. Example \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\) Oxygen gas was collected over water as shown above. The atmospheric pressure was 754 torr, the temperature was 22°C, and the volume of the gas was 155 mL. The vapor pressure of water at 22°C is 19.8 torr. Use this information to estimate the number of moles of \\(O_2\\) produced. Solution From Dalton's law, \\[P_{O_2} = P_{total} – P_{H_2O} = 754 – 19.8 = 734 \\; torr = 0.966\\; atm \\nonumber \\] Now use the Ideal Gas Law to convert to moles \\[ n =\\dfrac{PV}{RT} = \\dfrac{(0.966\\; atm)(0.155\\;L)}{(0.082\\; L atm mol^{-1} K^{-1})(295\\; K)}= 0.00619 \\; mol \\nonumber \\] Henry’s Law Henry's law is one of the gas laws formulated by William Henry in 1803. It states: \"At a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas that dissolves in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.\" An equivalent way of stating the law is that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. To explain this law, Henry derived the equation: \\[ C =k P_{gas} \\nonumber \\] where Henry’s Law tells us that the greater the pressure of gas above the surface of a liquid, the higher the concentration of the gas in the liquid. Also, Henry’s law tells us that gases diffuse from areas of high gas concentration to areas of low gas concentration. Applicability of Henry's Law Henry's law only works if the molecules are at equilibrium. Henry's law does not work for gases at high pressures (e.g., \\(N_{2\\;(g)}\\) at high pressure becomes very soluble and harmful when in the blood supply ). Henry's law does not work if there is a chemical reaction between the solute and solvent (e.g., \\(HCl_{(g)}\\) reacts with water by a dissociation reaction to generate \\(H_3O^+\\) and \\(Cl^-\\) ions). Application of Henry's Law: Scuba diving Our respiratory systems are designed to maintain the proper oxygen concentration in the blood when the partial pressure of O 2 is 0.21 atm, its normal sea-level value. Below the water surface, the pressure increases by 1 atm for each 10.3 m increase in depth; thus a scuba diver at 10.3 m experiences a total of 2 atm pressure pressing on the body. In order to prevent the lungs from collapsing, the air the diver breathes should also be at about the same pressure. But at a total pressure of 2 atm, the partial pressure of \\(O_2\\) in ordinary air would be 0.42 atm; at a depth of 100 ft (about 30 m), the \\(O_2\\) pressure of 0.8 atm would be far too high for health. For this reason, the air mixture in the pressurized tanks that scuba divers wear must contain a smaller fraction of \\(O_2\\). This can be achieved most simply by raising the nitrogen content, but high partial pressures of N 2 can also be dangerous, resulting in a condition known as nitrogen narcosis. The preferred diluting agent for sustained deep diving is helium, which has very little tendency to dissolve in the blood even at high pressures. Career Focus: Respiratory Therapist Certain diseases—such as emphysema, lung cancer, and severe asthma—primarily affect the lungs. Respiratory therapists help patients with breathing-related problems. They can evaluate, help diagnose, and treat breathing disorders and even help provide emergency assistance in acute illness where breathing is compromised. Most respiratory therapists must complete at least two years of college and earn an associate’s degree, although therapists can assume more responsibility if they have a college degree. Therapists must also pass state or national certification exams. Once certified, respiratory therapists can work in hospitals, doctor’s offices, nursing homes, or patient’s homes. Therapists work with equipment such as oxygen tanks and respirators, may sometimes dispense medication to aid in breathing, perform tests, and educate patients in breathing exercises and other therapy. Because respiratory therapists work directly with patients, the ability to work well with others is a must for this career. It is an important job because it deals with one of the most crucial functions of the body. Key Takeaway The physical properties of gases are predictable using mathematical formulas known as gas laws. \\(C\\) is the solubility of a gas at a fixed temperature in a particular solvent (in units of M or mL gas/L) \\(k\\) is Henry's law constant (often in units of M/atm) \\(P_{gas}\\) is the partial pressure of the gas (often in units of Atm)",
         "Learning Objectives To predict the properties of gases using the gas laws. Experience has shown that several properties of a gas can be related to each other under certain conditions. The properties are pressure ( P ), volume ( V ), temperature ( T , in kelvins), and amount of material expressed in moles ( n ). What we find is that a sample of gas cannot have any random values for these properties. Instead, only certain values, dictated by some simple mathematical relationships, will occur. Boyle’s Law The first simple relationship, referred to as a gas law, is between the pressure of a gas and its volume. If the amount of gas in a sample and its temperature are kept constant, then as the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume of the gas decreases proportionately. Mathematically, this is written as \\[\\mathrm{P \\propto \\dfrac{1}{V}} \\nonumber \\] where the “∝” symbol means “is proportional to.” This is one form of Boyle’s law, which relates the pressure of a gas to its volume. A more useful form of Boyle’s law involves a change in conditions of a gas. For a given amount of gas at a constant temperature, if we know the initial pressure and volume of a gas sample and the pressure or volume changes, we can calculate what the new volume or pressure will be. That form of Boyle’s law is written \\[P_iV_i = P_fV_f \\label{Eq1} \\] where the subscript \\(i\\) refers to initial conditions and the subscript \\(f\\) refers to final conditions. To use \\(\\ref{Eq1}\\), you need to know any three of the variables so that you can algebraically calculate the fourth variable. Also, the pressure quantities must have the same units, as must the two volume quantities. If the two similar variables don’t have the same variables, one value must be converted to the other value’s unit. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Increasing Pressure in a Gas What happens to the volume of a gas if its pressure is increased? Assume all other conditions remain the same. Solution If the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume decreases in response. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Increasing Volume in a Gas What happens to the pressure of a gas if its volume is increased? Assume all other conditions remain the same. Answer If the volume of a gas is increased, the pressure decreases. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): Gas Compression If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is reduced to 0.987 atm? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Solution The key in problems like this is to be able to identify which quantities represent which variables from the relevant equation. The way the question is worded, you should be able to tell that 1.56 atm is P i , 7.02 L is V i , and 0.987 atm is P f . What we are looking for is the final volume— V f . Therefore, substituting these values into P i V i = P f V f : (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (0.987 atm) × V f The expression has atmospheres on both sides of the equation, so they cancel algebraically: (1.56)(7.02 L) = (0.987) × V f Now we divide both sides of the expression by 0.987 to isolate V f , the quantity we are seeking: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(1.56)(7.02\\: L)}{0.987}=V_f}\\) Performing the multiplication and division, we get the value of V f , which is 11.1 L. The volume increases. This should make sense because the pressure decreases, so pressure and volume are inversely related. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 3.66 atm and an initial volume of 11.8 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is reduced to 5.09 L? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Answer 8.48 atm If the units of similar quantities are not the same, one of them must be converted to the other quantity’s units for the calculation to work out properly. It does not matter which quantity is converted to a different unit; the only thing that matters is that the conversion and subsequent algebra are performed properly. The following example illustrates this process. Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is changed to 1,775 torr? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Solution This example is similar to Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\), except now the final pressure is expressed in torr. For the math to work out properly, one of the pressure values must be converted to the other unit. Let us change the initial pressure to torr: \\(\\mathrm{1.56\\: atm\\times\\dfrac{760\\: torr}{1\\: atm}=1,190\\: torr}\\) Now we can use Boyle’s law: (1,190 torr)(7.02 L) = (1,775 torr) × V f Torr cancels algebraically from both sides of the equation, leaving (1,190)(7.02 L) = (1,775) × V f Now we divide both sides of the equation by 1,775 to isolate V f on one side. Solving for the final volume, \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1,190)(7.02\\: L)}{1,775}=4.71\\: L}\\) Because the pressure increases, it makes sense that the volume decreases. The answer for the final volume is essentially the same if we converted the 1,775 torr to atmospheres: \\(\\mathrm{1,775\\: torr\\times\\dfrac{1\\: atm}{760\\: torr}=2.336\\: atm}\\). Using Boyle’s law: (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (2.335 atm) × V f ; \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1.56\\: atm)(7.02\\: L)}{2.336\\: atm}=4.69\\: L}\\). Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 375 torr and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is changed to 4,577 mL? Does the answer make sense? Assume that amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant. Answer 575 torr To Your Health: Breathing Breathing certainly is a major contribution to your health! Without breathing, we could not survive. Curiously, the act of breathing itself is little more than an application of Boyle’s law. The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called alveoli. It is in the alveoli that oxygen from the air transfers to the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream transfers to the lungs for exhalation. For air to move in and out of the lungs, the pressure inside the lungs must change, forcing the lungs to change volume—just as predicted by Boyle’s law. The pressure change is caused by the diaphragm, a muscle that covers the bottom of the lungs. When the diaphragm moves down, it expands the size of our lungs. When this happens, the air pressure inside our lungs decreases slightly. This causes new air to rush in, and we inhale. The pressure decrease is slight—only 3 torr, or about 0.4% of an atmosphere. We inhale only 0.5–1.0 L of air per normal breath. Exhaling air requires that we relax the diaphragm, which pushes against the lungs and slightly decreases the volume of the lungs. This slightly increases the pressure of the air in the lungs, and air is forced out; we exhale. Only 1–2 torr of extra pressure is needed to exhale. So with every breath, our own bodies are performing an experimental test of Boyle’s law. Charles’s Law Another simple gas law relates the volume of a gas to its temperature. Experiments indicate that as the temperature of a gas sample is increased, its volume increases as long as the pressure and the amount of gas remain constant. The way to write this mathematically is \\[\\mathrm V \\propto T \\nonumber \\] At this point, the concept of temperature must be clarified. Although the Kelvin scale is the preferred temperature scale, the Celsius scale is also a common temperature scale used in science. The Celsius scale is based on the melting and boiling points of water and is actually the common temperature scale used by most countries around the world (except for the United States, which still uses the Fahrenheit scale). The value of a Celsius temperature is directly related to its Kelvin value by a simple expression: Kelvin temperature = Celsius temperature + 273 Thus, it is easy to convert from one temperature scale to another. The Kelvin scale is sometimes referred to as the absolute scale because the zero point on the Kelvin scale is at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. On the other temperature scales, absolute zero is −260°C or −459°F. The expression relating a gas volume to its temperature begs the following question: to which temperature scale is the volume of a gas related? The answer is that gas volumes are directly related to the Kelvin temperature . Therefore, the temperature of a gas sample should always be expressed in (or converted to) a Kelvin temperature. Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Increasing Temperature What happens to the volume of a gas if its temperature is decreased? Assume that all other conditions remain constant. Solution If the temperature of a gas sample is decreased, the volume decreases as well. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) What happens to the temperature of a gas if its volume is increased? Assume that all other conditions remain constant. Answer The temperature increases. As with Boyle’s law, the relationship between volume and temperature can be expressed in terms of initial and final values of volume and temperature, as follows: \\[\\mathrm{\\dfrac{V_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{V_f}{T_f}} \\nonumber \\] where V i and T i are the initial volume and temperature, and V f and T f are the final volume and temperature. This is Charles’s law. The restriction on its use is that the pressure of the gas and the amount of gas must remain constant. (Charles’s law is sometimes referred to as Gay-Lussac’s law, after the scientist who promoted Charles’s work.) Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) A gas sample at 20°C has an initial volume of 20.0 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to 60°C? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant. Solution Although the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, we must convert them to the kelvins before we can use Charles’s law. Thus, 20°C + 273 = 293 K = T i 60°C + 273 = 333 K = T f Now we can substitute these values into Charles’s law, along with the initial volume of 20.0 L: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{20.0\\: L}{293\\: K}=\\dfrac{V_f}{333\\: K}}\\) Multiplying the 333 K to the other side of the equation, we see that our temperature units will cancel: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(333\\: K)(20.0\\: L)}{293\\: K}=V_f}\\) Solving for the final volume, V f = 22.7 L. So, as the temperature is increased, the volume increases. This makes sense because volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (as long as the pressure and the amount of the remain constant). Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) A gas sample at 35°C has an initial volume of 5.06 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to −35°C? Does the answer make sense? Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant. Answer 3.91 L Combined Gas Law Other gas laws can be constructed, but we will focus on only two more. The combined gas law brings Boyle’s and Charles’s laws together to relate pressure, volume, and temperature changes of a gas sample: \\[\\mathrm{\\dfrac{P_iV_i}{T_i}=\\dfrac{P_fV_f}{T_f}} \\nonumber \\] To apply this gas law, the amount of gas should remain constant. As with the other gas laws, the temperature must be expressed in kelvins, and the units on the similar quantities should be the same. Because of the dependence on three quantities at the same time, it is difficult to tell in advance what will happen to one property of a gas sample as two other properties change. The best way to know is to work it out mathematically. Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) A sample of gas has P i = 1.50 atm, V i = 10.5 L, and T i = 300 K. What is the final volume if P f = 0.750 atm and T f = 350 K? Solution Using the combined gas law, substitute for five of the quantities: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(1.50\\: atm)(10.5\\: L)}{300\\: K}=\\dfrac{(0.750\\: atm)(V_f)}{350\\: K}}\\) We algebraically rearrange this expression to isolate V f on one side of the equation: \\(\\mathrm{V_f=\\dfrac{(1.50\\: atm)(10.5\\: L)(350\\: K)}{(300\\: K)(0.750\\: atm)}=24.5\\: L}\\) Note how all the units cancel except the unit for volume. A sample of gas has P i = 0.768 atm, V i = 10.5 L, and T i = 300 K. What is the final pressure if V f = 7.85 L and T f = 250 K? Answer 0.856 atm Example \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\) A balloon containing a sample of gas has a temperature of 22°C and a pressure of 1.09 atm in an airport in Cleveland. The balloon has a volume of 1,070 mL. The balloon is transported by plane to Denver, where the temperature is 11°C and the pressure is 655 torr. What is the new volume of the balloon? Solution The first task is to convert all quantities to the proper and consistent units. The temperatures must be expressed in kelvins, and the pressure units are different so one of the quantities must be converted. Let us convert the atmospheres to torr: 22°C + 273 = 295 K = T i 11°C + 273 = 284 K = T f \\(\\mathrm{1.09\\: atm\\times\\dfrac{760\\: torr}{1\\: atm}=828\\: torr = P_i}\\) Now we can substitute the quantities into the combined has law: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(828\\: torr)(1,070\\: mL)}{295\\: K}=\\dfrac{(655\\: torr)\\times V_f}{284\\: K}}\\) To solve for V f , we multiply the 284 K in the denominator of the right side into the numerator on the left, and we divide 655 torr in the numerator of the right side into the denominator on the left: \\(\\mathrm{\\dfrac{(828\\: torr)(1,070\\: mL)(284\\: K)}{(295\\: K)(655\\: torr)}=V_f}\\) Notice that torr and kelvins cancel, as they are found in both the numerator and denominator. The only unit that remains is milliliters, which is a unit of volume. So V f = 1,300 mL. The overall change is that the volume of the balloon has increased by 230 mL. A balloon used to lift weather instruments into the atmosphere contains gas having a volume of 1,150 L on the ground, where the pressure is 0.977 atm and the temperature is 18°C. Aloft, this gas has a pressure of 6.88 torr and a temperature of −15°C. What is the new volume of the gas? Answer 110,038 L The Ideal Gas Law So far, the gas laws we have used have focused on changing one or more properties of the gas, such as its volume, pressure, or temperature. There is one gas law that relates all the independent properties of a gas under any particular condition, rather than a change in conditions. This gas law is called the ideal gas law. The formula of this law is as follows: PV = nRT In this equation, P is pressure, V is volume, n is amount of moles, and T is temperature. R is called the ideal gas law constant and is a proportionality constant that relates the values of pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas sample. The variables in this equation do not have the subscripts i and f to indicate an initial condition and a final condition. The ideal gas law relates the four independent properties of a gas under any conditions. The value of R depends on what units are used to express the other quantities. If volume is expressed in liters and pressure in atmospheres, then the proper value of R is as follows: \\[\\mathrm{R=0.08205 \\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}} \\nonumber \\] This may seem like a strange unit, but that is what is required for the units to work out algebraically. Example \\(\\PageIndex{8}\\) What is the volume in liters of 1.45 mol of N 2 gas at 298 K and 3.995 atm? Solution Using the ideal gas law where P = 3.995 atm, n = 1.45, and T = 298, \\(\\mathrm{(3.995\\: atm)\\times V=(1.45\\: mol)\\left(0.08205\\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}\\right)(298\\: K)}\\) On the right side, the moles and kelvins cancel. Also, because atmospheres appear in the numerator on both sides of the equation, they also cancel. The only remaining unit is liters, a unit of volume. So 3.995 × V = (1.45)(0.08205)(298) L Dividing both sides of the equation by 3.995 and evaluating, we get V = 8.87 L. Note that the conditions of the gas are not changing. Rather, the ideal gas law allows us to determine what the fourth property of a gas (here, volume) must be if three other properties (here, amount, pressure, and temperature) are known. What is the pressure of a sample of CO 2 gas if 0.557 mol is held in a 20.0 L container at 451 K? Answer 1.03 atm For convenience, scientists have selected 273 K (0°C) and 1.00 atm pressure as a set of standard conditions for gases. This combination of conditions is called standard temperature and pressure (STP). Under these conditions, 1 mol of any gas has about the same volume. We can use the ideal gas law to determine the volume of 1 mol of gas at STP: \\[\\mathrm{(1.00\\: atm)\\times V=(1.00\\: mol)\\left(0.08205\\: \\dfrac{L\\cdot atm}{mol\\cdot K}\\right)(273\\: K)} \\nonumber \\] This volume is 22.4 L. Because this volume is independent of the identity of a gas, the idea that 1 mol of gas has a volume of 22.4 L at STP makes a convenient conversion factor: 1 mol gas = 22.4 L (at STP) Example \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\) Cyclopropane (C 3 H 6 ) is a gas that formerly was used as an anesthetic. How many moles of gas are there in a 100.0 L sample if the gas is at STP? Solution We can set up a simple, one-step conversion that relates moles and liters: \\(\\mathrm{100.0\\: L\\: C_3H_6\\times \\dfrac{1\\: mol}{22.4\\: L}=4.46\\: mol\\: C_3H_6}\\) There are almost 4.5 mol of gas in 100.0 L. Note: Because of its flammability, cyclopropane is no longer used as an anesthetic gas. Freon is a trade name for a series of fluorine- and chlorine-containing gases that formerly were used in refrigeration systems. What volume does 8.75 mol of Freon have at STP? Note: Many gases known as Freon are no longer used because their presence in the atmosphere destroys the ozone layer, which protects us from ultraviolet light from the sun. Answer 196 L Airbags Airbags (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)) are a safety feature provided in most automobiles since the 1990s. The effective operation of an airbag requires that it be rapidly inflated with an appropriate amount (volume) of gas when the vehicle is involved in a collision. This requirement is satisfied in many automotive airbag systems through use of explosive chemical reactions, one common choice being the decomposition of sodium azide, NaN 3 . When sensors in the vehicle detect a collision, an electrical current is passed through a carefully measured amount of NaN 3 to initiate its decomposition: \\[\\ce{2NaN3}(s)\\rightarrow \\ce{3N2}(g)+\\ce{2Na}(s) \\nonumber \\] This reaction is very rapid, generating gaseous nitrogen that can deploy and fully inflate a typical airbag in a fraction of a second (~0.03–0.1 s). Among many engineering considerations, the amount of sodium azide used must be appropriate for generating enough nitrogen gas to fully inflate the air bag and ensure its proper function. For example, a small mass (~100 g) of NaN 3 will generate approximately 50 L of N 2 . Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures The ideal gas equation of state applies to mixtures just as to pure gases. It was in fact with a gas mixture, ordinary air, that Boyle, Gay-Lussac and Charles did their early experiments. The only new concept we need in order to deal with gas mixtures is the partial pressure , a concept invented by the famous English chemist John Dalton (1766-1844). Dalton reasoned that the low density and high compressibility of gases indicates that they consist mostly of empty space; from this it follows that when two or more different gases occupy the same volume, they behave entirely independently. The contribution that each component of a gaseous mixture makes to the total pressure of the gas is known as the partial pressure of that gas. The definition of Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures that address this is: The total pressure of a gas is the sum of the partial pressures of its components which is expressed algebraically as \\[P_{total}=P_1+P_2+P_3 ... = \\sum_i P_i \\nonumber \\] or, equivalently \\[ P_{total} = \\dfrac{RT}{V} \\sum_i n_i \\nonumber \\] There is also a similar relationship based on volume fractions , known as Amagat's law of partial volumes . It is exactly analogous to Dalton's law, in that it states that the total volume of a mixture is just the sum of the partial volumes of its components. But there are two important differences: Amagat's law holds only for ideal gases which must all be at the same temperature and pressure. Dalton's law has neither of these restrictions. Although Amagat's law seems intuitively obvious, it sometimes proves useful in chemical engineering applications. We will make no use of it in this course. Example \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\) Three flasks having different volumes and containing different gases at various pressures are connected by stopcocks as shown. When the stopcocks are opened, What will be the pressure in the system? Which gas will be most abundant in the mixture? Assume that the temperature is uniform and that the volume of the connecting tubes is negligible. Solution The trick here is to note that the total number of moles n T and the temperature remain unchanged, so we can make use of Boyle's law PV = constant. We will work out the details for CO 2 only, denoted by subscripts a. For CO 2 , \\[P_aV_a = (2.13\\; atm)(1.50\\; L) = 3.20\\; L \\cdot atm \\nonumber \\] Adding the PV products for each separate container, we obtain \\[A\\sum_i P_i V_i = 6.36\\; L \\cdot atm = n_T RT \\nonumber \\] We will call this sum P 1 V 1 . After the stopcocks have been opened and the gases mix, the new conditions are denoted by P 2 V 2 . From Boyle's law (\\(\\ref{Eq1}\\), \\[P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 = 6.36\\; L \\cdot atm \\nonumber \\] \\[V_2 = \\sum_i V_i = 4.50\\; L \\nonumber \\] Solving for the final pressure P 2 we obtain (6.36 L-atm)/(4.50 L) = 1.41 atm . For part (b) , note that the number of moles of each gas is n = PV/RT . The mole fraction of any one gas is X i = n i / n T . For CO 2 , this works out to (3.19/ RT ) / (6.36/ RT ) = 0.501. Because this exceeds 0.5, we know that this is the most abundant gas in the final mixture. Dalton’s law states that in a gas mixture (\\(P_{total}\\)) each gas will exert a pressure independent of the other gases (\\(P_n\\)) and each gas will behave as if it alone occupies the total volume. By extension, the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated by multiplying the total pressure (\\(P_{total}\\)) by the gas percentage (%). \\[P_{Total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 + ... + P_n \\nonumber \\] or \\[P_n = \\dfrac{\\text{% of individual gas}_n}{P_{Total}} \\nonumber \\] Gas Partial Pressure (mm Hg) Percentage (%) Nitrogen, (N_2\\) \\(P_{N_2}\\) = 594 78.000 Oxygen, \\(O_2\\) \\(P_{O_2}\\)= 160 21.000 Carbon Dioxide, \\(CO_2\\) \\(P_{CO_2}\\) = 0.25 0.033 Water Vapor, \\(H_2O\\) \\(P_{H_2O}\\) = 5.7 0.750 Other trace gases \\(P_{Other}\\) = 0.05 0.220 Total air \\(P_{Total}\\) = 760 1.000 Application of Dalton's Law: Collecting Gases over Water A common laboratory method of collecting the gaseous product of a chemical reaction is to conduct it into an inverted tube or bottle filled with water, the opening of which is immersed in a larger container of water. This arrangement is called a pneumatic trough , and was widely used in the early days of chemistry. As the gas enters the bottle it displaces the water and becomes trapped in the upper part. The volume of the gas can be observed by means of a calibrated scale on the bottle, but what about its pressure? The total pressure confining the gas is just that of the atmosphere transmitting its force through the water. (An exact calculation would also have to take into account the height of the water column in the inverted tube.) But liquid water itself is always in equilibrium with its vapor, so the space in the top of the tube is a mixture of two gases: the gas being collected, and gaseous H 2 O. The partial pressure of H 2 O is known as the vapor pressure of water and it depends on the temperature. In order to determine the quantity of gas we have collected, we must use Dalton's Law to find the partial pressure of that gas. Example \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\) Oxygen gas was collected over water as shown above. The atmospheric pressure was 754 torr, the temperature was 22°C, and the volume of the gas was 155 mL. The vapor pressure of water at 22°C is 19.8 torr. Use this information to estimate the number of moles of \\(O_2\\) produced. Solution From Dalton's law, \\[P_{O_2} = P_{total} – P_{H_2O} = 754 – 19.8 = 734 \\; torr = 0.966\\; atm \\nonumber \\] Now use the Ideal Gas Law to convert to moles \\[ n =\\dfrac{PV}{RT} = \\dfrac{(0.966\\; atm)(0.155\\;L)}{(0.082\\; L atm mol^{-1} K^{-1})(295\\; K)}= 0.00619 \\; mol \\nonumber \\] Henry’s Law Henry's law is one of the gas laws formulated by William Henry in 1803. It states: \"At a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas that dissolves in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.\" An equivalent way of stating the law is that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. To explain this law, Henry derived the equation: \\[ C =k P_{gas} \\nonumber \\] where Henry’s Law tells us that the greater the pressure of gas above the surface of a liquid, the higher the concentration of the gas in the liquid. Also, Henry’s law tells us that gases diffuse from areas of high gas concentration to areas of low gas concentration. Applicability of Henry's Law Henry's law only works if the molecules are at equilibrium. Henry's law does not work for gases at high pressures (e.g., \\(N_{2\\;(g)}\\) at high pressure becomes very soluble and harmful when in the blood supply ). Henry's law does not work if there is a chemical reaction between the solute and solvent (e.g., \\(HCl_{(g)}\\) reacts with water by a dissociation reaction to generate \\(H_3O^+\\) and \\(Cl^-\\) ions). Application of Henry's Law: Scuba diving Our respiratory systems are designed to maintain the proper oxygen concentration in the blood when the partial pressure of O 2 is 0.21 atm, its normal sea-level value. Below the water surface, the pressure increases by 1 atm for each 10.3 m increase in depth; thus a scuba diver at 10.3 m experiences a total of 2 atm pressure pressing on the body. In order to prevent the lungs from collapsing, the air the diver breathes should also be at about the same pressure. But at a total pressure of 2 atm, the partial pressure of \\(O_2\\) in ordinary air would be 0.42 atm; at a depth of 100 ft (about 30 m), the \\(O_2\\) pressure of 0.8 atm would be far too high for health. For this reason, the air mixture in the pressurized tanks that scuba divers wear must contain a smaller fraction of \\(O_2\\). This can be achieved most simply by raising the nitrogen content, but high partial pressures of N 2 can also be dangerous, resulting in a condition known as nitrogen narcosis. The preferred diluting agent for sustained deep diving is helium, which has very little tendency to dissolve in the blood even at high pressures. Career Focus: Respiratory Therapist Certain diseases—such as emphysema, lung cancer, and severe asthma—primarily affect the lungs. Respiratory therapists help patients with breathing-related problems. They can evaluate, help diagnose, and treat breathing disorders and even help provide emergency assistance in acute illness where breathing is compromised. Most respiratory therapists must complete at least two years of college and earn an associate’s degree, although therapists can assume more responsibility if they have a college degree. Therapists must also pass state or national certification exams. Once certified, respiratory therapists can work in hospitals, doctor’s offices, nursing homes, or patient’s homes. Therapists work with equipment such as oxygen tanks and respirators, may sometimes dispense medication to aid in breathing, perform tests, and educate patients in breathing exercises and other therapy. Because respiratory therapists work directly with patients, the ability to work well with others is a must for this career. It is an important job because it deals with one of the most crucial functions of the body. Key Takeaway The physical properties of gases are predictable using mathematical formulas known as gas laws. \\(C\\) is the solubility of a gas at a fixed temperature in a particular solvent (in units of M or mL gas/L) \\(k\\) is Henry's law constant (often in units of M/atm) \\(P_{gas}\\) is the partial pressure of the gas (often in units of Atm)"

         "Learning Objectives Write the correct formula for an ionic compound. Recognize polyatomic ions in chemical formulas. Ionic compounds do not exist as molecules. In the solid state, ionic compounds are in crystal lattice containing many ions each of the cation and anion. An ionic formula, like \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), is an empirical formula. This formula merely indicates that sodium chloride is made of an equal number of sodium and chloride ions. Sodium sulfide, another ionic compound, has the formula \\(\\ce{Na_2S}\\). This formula indicates that this compound is made up of twice as many sodium ions as sulfide ions. This section will teach you how to find the correct ratio of ions, so that you can write a correct formula. If you know the name of a binary ionic compound, you can write its chemical formula . Start by writing the metal ion with its charge, followed by the nonmetal ion with its charge. Because the overall compound must be electrically neutral, decide how many of each ion is needed in order for the positive and negative charges to cancel each other out.

Because these ions contain more than one atom, they are called polyatomic ions. Polyatomic ions have characteristic formulas, names, and charges that should be memorized. For example, NO 3 − is the nitrate ion; it has one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms and an overall 1− charge. Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) lists the most common polyatomic ions. Name Formula ammonium ion NH4+ acetate ion C2H3O2− (also written CH3CO2−) carbonate ion CO32− chromate ion CrO42− dichromate ion Cr2O72− hydrogen carbonate ion (bicarbonate ion) HCO3− cyanide ion CN− hydroxide ion OH− nitrate ion NO3− nitrite ion NO2− permanganate ion MnO4− phosphate ion PO43− hydrogen phosphate ion HPO42− dihydrogen phosphate ion H2PO4− sulfate ion SO42− hydrogen sulfate ion (bisulfate ion) HSO4− sulfite ion SO32− The rule for constructing formulas for ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions is the same as for formulas containing monatomic (single-atom) ions: the positive and negative charges must balance. If more than one of a particular polyatomic ion is needed to balance the charge, the entire formula for the polyatomic ion must be enclosed in parentheses, and the numerical subscript is placed outside the parentheses. This is to show that the subscript applies to the entire polyatomic ion. An example is Ba(NO 3 ) 2 . Writing Formulas for Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions Writing a formula for ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions also involves the same steps as for a binary ionic compound. Write the symbol and charge of the cation followed by the symbol and charge of the anion. Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Calcium Nitrate Write the formula for calcium nitrate.

Transpose only the number of the positive charge to become the subscript of the anion and the number only of the negative charge to become the subscript of the cation.

If there is only 1 of the polyatomic ion, leave off parentheses. \\(\\ce{Ca(NO_3)_2}\\) Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of the potassium ion and the sulfate ion. Solution Explanation Answer Potassium ions have a charge of 1+, while sulfate ions have a charge of 2−. We will need two potassium ions to balance the charge on the sulfate ion, so the proper chemical formula is \\(\\ce{K2SO4}\\). \\(\\ce{K_2SO_4}\\) Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\) Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of each pair of ions. the magnesium ion and the carbonate ion the aluminum ion and the acetate ion Answer a: \\(\\ce{MgCO3}\\) Answer b: \\(\\ce{Al(CH3COO)3}\\) Recognizing Ionic Compounds There are two ways to recognize ionic compounds. Method 1 Compounds between metal and nonmetal elements are usually ionic. For example, \\(\\ce{CaBr2}\\) contains a metallic element (calcium, a group 2 [or 2A] metal) and a nonmetallic element (bromine, a group 17 [or 7A] nonmetal). Therefore, it is most likely an ionic compound (in fact, it is ionic). In contrast, the compound \\(\\ce{NO2}\\) contains two elements that are both nonmetals (nitrogen, from group 15 [or 5A] , and oxygen, from group 16 [or 6A] . It is not an ionic compound; it belongs to the category of covalent compounds discussed elsewhere. Also note that this combination of nitrogen and oxygen has no electric charge specified, so it is not the nitrite ion. Method 2 Second, if you recognize the formula of a polyatomic ion in a compound, the compound is ionic. For example, if you see the formula \\(\\ce{Ba(NO3)2}\\), you may recognize the “\\(\\ce{NO3}\\)” part as the nitrate ion, \\(\\ce{NO3^{-}}\\). (Remember that the convention for writing formulas for ionic compounds is not to include the ionic charge.) This is a clue that the other part of the formula, \\(\\ce{Ba}\\), is actually the \\(\\ce{Ba^{2+}}\\) ion, with the 2+ charge balancing the overall 2− charge from the two nitrate ions. Thus, this compound is also ionic. Example \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) Identify each compound as ionic or not ionic. \\(\\ce{Na2O}\\) \\(\\ce{PCl3}\\) \\(\\ce{NH4Cl}\\) \\(\\ce{OF2}\\) Solution Explanation Answer a. Sodium is a metal, and oxygen is a nonmetal. Therefore, \\(\\ce{Na2O}\\) is expected to be ionic via method 1. \\(\\ce{Na2O}\\), ionic b. Both phosphorus and chlorine are nonmetals. Therefore, \\(\\ce{PCl3}\\) is not ionic via method 1 \\(\\ce{PCl3}\\), not ionic c. The \\(\\ce{NH4}\\) in the formula represents the ammonium ion, \\(\\ce{NH4^{+}}\\), which indicates that this compound is ionic via method 2 \\(\\ce{NH4Cl}\\), ionic d. Both oxygen and fluorine are nonmetals. Therefore, \\(\\ce{OF2}\\) is not ionic via method 1 \\(\\ce{OF2}\\), not ionic Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) Identify each compound as ionic or not ionic. \\(\\ce{N2O}\\) \\(\\ce{FeCl3}\\) \\(\\ce{(NH4)3PO4}\\) \\(\\ce{SOCl2}\\) Answer a: not ionic Answer b: ionic Answer c: ionic Answer d: not ionic Summary Formulas for ionic compounds contain the symbols and number of each atom present in a compound in the lowest whole number ratio.",
         "Learning Objectives Write the correct formula for an ionic compound. Recognize polyatomic ions in chemical formulas. Ionic compounds do not exist as molecules. In the solid state, ionic compounds are in crystal lattice containing many ions each of the cation and anion. An ionic formula, like \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), is an empirical formula. This formula merely indicates that sodium chloride is made of an equal number of sodium and chloride ions. Sodium sulfide, another ionic compound, has the formula \\(\\ce{Na_2S}\\). This formula indicates that this compound is made up of twice as many sodium ions as sulfide ions. This section will teach you how to find the correct ratio of ions, so that you can write a correct formula. If you know the name of a binary ionic compound, you can write its chemical formula . Start by writing the metal ion with its charge, followed by the nonmetal ion with its charge. Because the overall compound must be electrically neutral, decide how many of each ion is needed in order for the positive and negative charges to cancel each other out. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Aluminum Nitride and Lithium Oxide Write the formulas for aluminum nitride and lithium oxide. Solution Unnamed: 0 Write the formula for aluminum nitride Write the formula for lithium oxide 1.

Use a multiplier to make the total charge of the cations and anions equal to each other. total charge of cations = total charge of anions 1(3+) = 1(3-) +3 = -3 total charge of cations = total charge of anions 2(1+) = 1(2-) +2 = -2 3. Use the multipliers as subscript for each ion. \\(\\ce{Al_1N_1}\\) \\(\\ce{Li_2O_1}\\) 4. Write the final formula. Leave out all charges and all subscripts that are 1. \\(\\ce{AlN}\\) \\(\\ce{Li_2O}\\) An alternative way to writing a correct formula for an ionic compound is to use the crisscross method . In this method, the numerical value of each of the ion charges is crossed over to become the subscript of the other ion. Signs of the charges are dropped. Example \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): The Crisscross Method for Lead (IV) Oxide Write the formula for lead (IV) oxide. Solution Crisscross Method Write the formula for lead (IV) oxide 1.

         "Learning Objectives To use the rules for naming ionic compounds. After learning a few more details about the names of individual ions, you will be one step away from knowing how to name ionic compounds. This section begins the formal study of nomenclature, the systematic naming of chemical compounds. Naming Ions The name of a monatomic cation is simply the name of the element followed by the word ion . Thus, Na + is the sodium ion, Al 3 + is the aluminum ion, Ca 2 + is the calcium ion, and so forth. We have seen that some elements lose different numbers of electrons, producing ions of different charges (Figure 3.3). Iron, for example, can form two cations, each of which, when combined with the same anion, makes a different compound with unique physical and chemical properties. Thus, we need a different name for each iron ion to distinguish Fe 2 + from Fe 3 + . The same issue arises for other ions with more than one possible charge. There are two ways to make this distinction. In the simpler, more modern approach, called the Stock system , an ion’s positive charge is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the element name, followed by the word ion . Thus, Fe 2 + is called the iron(II) ion, while Fe 3 + is called the iron(III) ion. This system is used only for elements that form more than one common positive ion. We do not call the Na + ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary. Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion . Element Stem Charge Modern Name Common Name iron ferr- 2+ iron(II) ion ferrous ion iron ferr- 3+ iron(III) ion ferric ion copper cupr- 1+ copper(I) ion cuprous ion copper cupr- 2+ copper(II) ion cupric ion tin stann- 2+ tin(II) ion stannous ion tin stann- 4+ tin(IV) ion stannic ion lead plumb- 2+ lead(II) ion plumbous ion lead plumb- 4+ lead(IV) ion plumbic ion chromium chrom- 2+ chromium(II) ion chromous ion chromium chrom- 3+ chromium(III) ion chromic ion gold aur- 1+ gold(I) ion aurous ion gold aur- 3+ gold(III) ion auric ion The second system, called the common system , is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences. This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations. The common system uses two suffixes (- ic and - ous ) that are appended to the stem of the element name. The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one. In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element. Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names. Ion Name F− fluoride ion Cl− chloride ion Br− bromide ion I− iodide ion O2− oxide ion S2− sulfide ion P3− phosphide ion N3− nitride ion The name of a monatomic anion consists of the stem of the element name, the suffix - ide , and then the word ion . Thus, as we have already seen, Cl − is “chlor-” + “-ide ion,” or the chloride ion. Similarly, O 2− is the oxide ion, Se 2 − is the selenide ion, and so forth. Table \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) lists the names of some common monatomic ions. The polyatomic ions have their own characteristic names, as discussed earlier. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Name each ion.

The metal cation is named first, followed by the nonmetal anion as illustrated in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) for the compound BaCl 2 . The word ion is dropped from both parts. Subscripts in the formula do not affect the name. Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): Naming Ionic Compounds Name each ionic compound. CaCl 2 AlF 3 KCl Solution Using the names of the ions, this ionic compound is named calcium chloride. The name of this ionic compound is aluminum fluoride. The name of this ionic compound is potassium chloride Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Name each ionic compound. AgI MgO Ca 3 P 2 Answer a: silver iodide Answer b: magnesium oxide Answer c: calcium phosphide Naming Binary Ionic Compounds with a Metal That Forms More Than One Type of Cation If you are given a formula for an ionic compound whose cation can have more than one possible charge, you must first determine the charge on the cation before identifying its correct name. For example, consider FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 . In the first compound, the iron ion has a 2+ charge because there are two Cl − ions in the formula (1− charge on each chloride ion). In the second compound, the iron ion has a 3+ charge, as indicated by the three Cl − ions in the formula. These are two different compounds that need two different names. By the Stock system, the names are iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)). Name of cation (metal) + (Roman Numeral in parenthesis) + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide Name of cation (metal) + (Roman Numeral in parenthesis) + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide.1 NaN NaN If we were to use the stems and suffixes of the common system, the names would be ferrous chloride and ferric chloride, respectively (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)) . \"Old\" base name of cation (metal) and -ic or -ous + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide \"Old\" base name of cation (metal) and -ic or -ous + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide.1 -ous (for ions with lower charge) -ic (for ions with higher charge) Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Name each ionic compound. Co 2 O 3 FeCl 2 Solution Unnamed: 0 Explanation Answer a We know that cobalt can have more than one possible charge; we just need to determine what it is. Oxide always has a 2− charge, so with three oxide ions, we have a total negative charge of 6−. This means that the two cobalt ions have to contribute 6+, which for two cobalt ions means that each one is 3+. Therefore, the proper name for this ionic compound is cobalt(III) oxide. cobalt(III) oxide b Iron can also have more than one possible charge. Chloride always has a 1− charge, so with two chloride ions, we have a total negative charge of 2−. This means that the one iron ion must have a 2+ charge. Therefore, the proper name for this ionic compound is iron(II) chloride. iron(II) chloride Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) Name each ionic compound. AuCl 3 PbO 2 CuO Answer a: gold(III) chloride Answer b: lead(IV) oxide Answer c: copper(II) oxide Naming Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions The process of naming ionic compounds with polyatomic ions is the same as naming binary ionic compounds. The cation is named first, followed by the anion. One example is the ammonium sulfate compound in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\). Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Naming Ionic Compounds Write the proper name for each ionic compound. (NH 4 ) 2 S AlPO 4 , Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 Solution Explanation Answer a. The ammonium ion has a 1+ charge and the sulfide ion has a 2− charge. Two ammonium ions need to balance the charge on a single sulfide ion. The compound’s name is ammonium sulfide. ammonium sulfide b. The ions have the same magnitude of charge, one of each (ion) is needed to balance the charges. The name of the compound is aluminum phosphate. aluminum phosphate c. Neither charge is an exact multiple of the other, so we have to go to the least common multiple of 6. To get 6+, three iron(II) ions are needed, and to get 6−, two phosphate ions are needed . The compound’s name is iron(II) phosphate. iron(II) phosphate Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5A}\\) Write the proper name for each ionic compound. (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 Co(NO 2 ) 3 Answer a: ammonium phosphate Answer b: cobalt(III) nitrite Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) is a synopsis of how to name simple ionic compounds.

ZnBr 2 Al 2 O 3 (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 AuF 3 AgF Answer a: zinc bromide Answer b: aluminum oxide Answer c: ammonium phosphate Answer d: gold(III) fluoride or auric fluoride Answer e: silver fluoride Summary Ionic compounds are named by stating the cation first, followed by the anion. Positive and negative charges must balance. Some anions have multiple forms and are named accordingly with the use of roman numerals in parentheses. Ternary compounds are composed of three or more elements.",

We do not call the Na + ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary. Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion . Element Stem Charge Modern Name Common Name iron ferr- 2+ iron(II) ion ferrous ion iron ferr- 3+ iron(III) ion ferric ion copper cupr- 1+ copper(I) ion cuprous ion copper cupr- 2+ copper(II) ion cupric ion tin stann- 2+ tin(II) ion stannous ion tin stann- 4+ tin(IV) ion stannic ion lead plumb- 2+ lead(II) ion plumbous ion lead plumb- 4+ lead(IV) ion plumbic ion chromium chrom- 2+ chromium(II) ion chromous ion chromium chrom- 3+ chromium(III) ion chromic ion gold aur- 1+ gold(I) ion aurous ion gold aur- 3+ gold(III) ion auric ion The second system, called the common system , is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences. This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations. The common system uses two suffixes (- ic and - ous ) that are appended to the stem of the element name. The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one. In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element. Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names. Ion Name F− fluoride ion Cl− chloride ion Br− bromide ion I− iodide ion O2− oxide ion S2− sulfide ion P3− phosphide ion N3− nitride ion The name of a monatomic anion consists of the stem of the element name, the suffix - ide , and then the word ion . Thus, as we have already seen, Cl − is “chlor-” + “-ide ion,” or the chloride ion. Similarly, O 2− is the oxide ion, Se 2 − is the selenide ion, and so forth. Table \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) lists the names of some common monatomic ions. The polyatomic ions have their own characteristic names, as discussed earlier. Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Name each ion. Ca 2 + S 2− SO 3 2 − NH 4 + Cu + Solution the calcium ion the sulfide ion the sulfite ion the ammonium ion the copper(I) ion or the cuprous ion Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Name each ion.

The metal cation is named first, followed by the nonmetal anion as illustrated in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) for the compound BaCl 2 . The word ion is dropped from both parts. Subscripts in the formula do not affect the name. Example \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): Naming Ionic Compounds Name each ionic compound. CaCl 2 AlF 3 KCl Solution Using the names of the ions, this ionic compound is named calcium chloride. The name of this ionic compound is aluminum fluoride. The name of this ionic compound is potassium chloride Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Name each ionic compound. AgI MgO Ca 3 P 2 Answer a: silver iodide Answer b: magnesium oxide Answer c: calcium phosphide Naming Binary Ionic Compounds with a Metal That Forms More Than One Type of Cation If you are given a formula for an ionic compound whose cation can have more than one possible charge, you must first determine the charge on the cation before identifying its correct name. For example, consider FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 . In the first compound, the iron ion has a 2+ charge because there are two Cl − ions in the formula (1− charge on each chloride ion). In the second compound, the iron ion has a 3+ charge, as indicated by the three Cl − ions in the formula. These are two different compounds that need two different names. By the Stock system, the names are iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)). Name of cation (metal) + (Roman Numeral in parenthesis) + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide Name of cation (metal) + (Roman Numeral in parenthesis) + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide.1 NaN NaN If we were to use the stems and suffixes of the common system, the names would be ferrous chloride and ferric chloride, respectively (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)) . \"Old\" base name of cation (metal) and -ic or -ous + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide \"Old\" base name of cation (metal) and -ic or -ous + Base name of anion (nonmetal) and -ide.1 -ous (for ions with lower charge) -ic (for ions with higher charge) Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Name each ionic compound. Co 2 O 3 FeCl 2 Solution Unnamed: 0 Explanation Answer a We know that cobalt can have more than one possible charge; we just need to determine what it is. Oxide always has a 2− charge, so with three oxide ions, we have a total negative charge of 6−. This means that the two cobalt ions have to contribute 6+, which for two cobalt ions means that each one is 3+. Therefore, the proper name for this ionic compound is cobalt(III) oxide. cobalt(III) oxide b Iron can also have more than one possible charge. Chloride always has a 1− charge, so with two chloride ions, we have a total negative charge of 2−. This means that the one iron ion must have a 2+ charge. Therefore, the proper name for this ionic compound is iron(II) chloride. iron(II) chloride Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) Name each ionic compound. AuCl 3 PbO 2 CuO Answer a: gold(III) chloride Answer b: lead(IV) oxide Answer c: copper(II) oxide Naming Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions The process of naming ionic compounds with polyatomic ions is the same as naming binary ionic compounds. The cation is named first, followed by the anion. One example is the ammonium sulfate compound in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\). Example \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Naming Ionic Compounds Write the proper name for each ionic compound. (NH 4 ) 2 S AlPO 4 , Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 Solution Explanation Answer a. The ammonium ion has a 1+ charge and the sulfide ion has a 2− charge. Two ammonium ions need to balance the charge on a single sulfide ion. The compound’s name is ammonium sulfide. ammonium sulfide b. The ions have the same magnitude of charge, one of each (ion) is needed to balance the charges. The name of the compound is aluminum phosphate. aluminum phosphate c. Neither charge is an exact multiple of the other, so we have to go to the least common multiple of 6. To get 6+, three iron(II) ions are needed, and to get 6−, two phosphate ions are needed . The compound’s name is iron(II) phosphate. iron(II) phosphate Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5A}\\) Write the proper name for each ionic compound. (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 Co(NO 2 ) 3 Answer a: ammonium phosphate Answer b: cobalt(III) nitrite Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) is a synopsis of how to name simple ionic compounds. Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{5B}\\) Name each ionic compound. ZnBr 2 Al 2 O 3 (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 AuF 3 AgF Answer a: zinc bromide Answer b: aluminum oxide Answer c: ammonium phosphate Answer d: gold(III) fluoride or auric fluoride Answer e: silver fluoride Summary Ionic compounds are named by stating the cation first, followed by the anion. Positive and negative charges must balance. Some anions have multiple forms and are named accordingly with the use of roman numerals in parentheses. Ternary compounds are composed of three or more elements."

         "Chiral molecules, as we learned in the introduction to this chapter, have an interesting optical property. You may know from studying physics that light waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields. In ordinary light, the oscillation is randomly oriented in an infinite number of planes. When ordinary light is passed through a polarizer, all planes of oscillation are filtered out except one, resulting in plane-polarized light . A beam of plane-polarized light, when passed through a sample of a chiral compound, interacts with the compound in such a way that the angle of oscillation will rotate. This property is called optical activity . If a compound rotates plane polarized light in the clockwise (+) direction, it is said to be dextrorotatory , while if it rotates light in the counterclockwise (-) direction it is levorotatory . The magnitude of the observed optical activity is dependent on temperature, the wavelength of light used, solvent, concentration of the chiral sample, and the path length of the sample tube (path length is the length that the plane-polarized light travels through the chiral sample). Typically, optical activity measurements are made in a 1 decimeter (10 cm) path-length sample tube at 25 ° C, using as a light source the so-called “D-line” from a sodium lamp, which has a wavelength of 589 nm. The specific rotation of a pure chiral compound at 25 ° is expressed by the expression: \\[[\\alpha]_{\\mathrm{D}}^{25}=\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{l c} \\nonumber\\] where \\(\\alpha_{obs}\\) is the observed rotation, \\(l\\) is path length in decimeters, and \\(c\\) is the concentration of the sample in grams per 100 mL. In other words, the specific rotation of a chiral compound is the optical rotation that is observed when 1 g of the compound is dissolved in enough of a given solvent to make 100 mL solution, and the rotation is measured in a 1 dm cuvette at 25 o C using light from a sodium lamp. Every chiral molecule has a characteristic specific rotation, which is recorded in the chemical literature as a physical property just like melting point or density. Different enantiomers of a compound will always rotate plane-polarized light with an equal but opposite magnitude. ( S )-ibuprofen, for example, has a specific rotation of +54.5 o (dextrorotatory) in methanol, while ( R )-ibuprofen has a specific rotation of -54.5 o . There is no relationship between chiral compound's R/S designation and the direction of its specific rotation. For example, the S enantiomer of ibuprofen is dextrorotatory, but the S enantiomer of glyceraldehyde is levorotatory. A 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers (a racemic mixture) will have no observable optical activity, because the two optical activities cancel each other out. In a structural drawing, a 'squigly' bond from a chiral center indicates a mixture of both R and S configurations. Chiral molecules are often labeled according to whether they are dextrorotatory or levorotatory as well as by their R/S designation. For example, the pure enantiomers of ibuprofen are labeled ( S )-(+)-ibuprofen and ( R )-(-)-ibuprofen, while ( ± )-ibuprofen refers to the racemic mixture, which is the form in which the drug is sold to consumers. Exercise 3.14 The specific rotation of ( R )-limonene is +11.5 o in ethanol. What is the expected observed rotation of a sample of 6.00 g ( S )-limonene dissolved in ethanol to a total volume of 80.0 mL in a 1.00 dm (10.0 cm) pathlength cuvette? Exercise 3.15 The specific rotation of ( S )-carvone is +61 ° , measured 'neat' (pure liquid sample, no solvent). The optical rotation of a mixture of R and S carvone is measured at -23 ° . Which enantiomer is in excess in the mixture? Solutions to exercises All of the twenty natural amino acids except glycine have a chiral center at their a lpha-carbon (recall that basic amino acid structure and terminology was introduced in section 1.3). Virtually all of the amino acids found in nature, both in the form of free amino acids or incorporated into peptides and proteins, have what is referred to in the biochemical literature as the ' L ' configuration: All but one of the 19 L -amino acids have S stereochemistry at the a- carbon, using the rules of the R/S naming system. D -amino acids are very rare in nature, but we will learn about an interesting example of a peptide containing one D -amino acid residue later in chapter 12.
